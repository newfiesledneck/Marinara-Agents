/**
 * Typecheck package-owned sources against the Engine tree they are compiled into.
 *
 * The feature bundler is esbuild, which strips types without checking them. Four separate
 * defects reached production this way — a route that read a variable belonging to another
 * handler, a component prop that was used but never declared, a hook that was never
 * imported — each of which built clean, passed lint, and threw at runtime.
 *
 * This overlays a package's sources onto the vendored Engine sources exactly as the bundler
 * does, then reports only the errors that mean "this name does not exist". A full typecheck
 * of the merged tree is not clean today, so a narrow, honest check that runs beats a broad
 * one that gets switched off.
 *
 * It also reports TS2307 for relative imports, so a moved or deleted package file cannot leave a
 * dangling import behind.
 *
 * Syntax diagnostics (TS1xxx) are reported unconditionally. TypeScript emits no semantic errors for
 * a file it could not parse, so without these a split panel with an unbalanced JSX fragment was
 * reported as clean while every undefined name in it went unmentioned. A syntax error is never
 * acceptable output, so this rule has no allowlist.
 *
 * ponytail: TS2304/TS2552, the missing-export family, relative TS2307 and all TS1xxx only. Bare specifiers are skipped because
 * the overlay installs no dependencies; widen once the merged tree typechecks against an Engine.
