// Contract checks for the `ruleset` package kind.
//
// A ruleset package is the one package shape in this catalog that ships no Agent
// and no code: its entire payload is validated data assets, `ruleset.json` plus
// any `catalogs/<id>.json` it declares, that the Engine reads by reserved
// filename. Every other package here is agent-shaped, so the agent-definition
// assertions in validate-catalog.mjs cannot apply to it and these checks stand in
// their place.
//
// Scope note: the Engine owns the `ruleset.json` schema and validates it on install.
// Re-implementing that schema here would give this repository a second copy of a
// contract it does not own, which would drift silently the first time the Engine
// adds a field. These checks cover only what the catalog itself needs to publish the
// asset honestly: that it parses, that it carries the identity the Engine keys on, and
// that the ids a catalog or a `battle` block points at exist on the sheet beside them.
//
// The functions are pure so they can be exercised directly by
// scripts/tests/ruleset-package.regression.mjs; validate-catalog.mjs does the file
// reading and calls them.
