# 5e (SRD 5.1)

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-19
- Battles now start from your character sheet. Your hit points and spell slots go into the fight, and when it ends the damage you took and the slots you spent are written back. Pact Magic slots do not transfer: their level follows the character, which the battle block cannot say yet.
- Your prepared spells and the weapons you picked from the catalogs show up as skills. Cantrips come too, because they are cast without being prepared. A row you typed by hand carries no numbers, so it stays out.
- Health is carried as a share of your maximum, so a character at half hit points starts the fight at half of the health bar.
- The damage is still Marinara's own combat math. Attack rolls, saving throws and concentration are not applied, so this is not a 5e combat system.
- SRD healing spells now heal: Cure Wounds, Healing Word, Mass Cure Wounds, Mass Healing Word, Prayer of Healing, Heal, Mass Heal and Regenerate.
- Needs an Engine with Capability API 1.22.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-19
- Adds catalogs: ready-made SRD 5.1 entries the character sheet editor offers in a picker, so you no longer type a spell list or a page of class features row by row. 319 spells, 208 class and subclass features, and 36 weapons.
- Picking a class feature that the SRD gives a plain number of uses, such as Second Wind, Rage or Ki, also fills in the class resource that tracks it.
- A picked row is a copy. Edit it however you like, and nothing rewrites your character later.
- Battles still use Marinara's default combat, so the numbers a catalog entry carries are recorded but not yet rolled.
- Needs an Engine with Capability API 1.21.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-18
- First release. Ships the 5e SRD 5.1 ruleset data for Game Mode ability checks, skill checks, saving throws, spell slots, hit dice, class resources, conditions, rests, and a full character sheet. Battles still use Marinara's default combat, not 5e combat.
- Available to Engine staging users only, and needs an Engine with Capability API 1.20.
