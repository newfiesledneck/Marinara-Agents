# Long-Term Memory changelog

## 1.3.6 — 2026-09-20

- Preserved actionable extraction error codes and retryability, and reused one deterministic vault snapshot for Game Mode batch imports.
- Classified permanent provider quota failures as non-retryable and kept deterministic snapshot failures within their batch results.

## 1.3.5 — 2026-09-20

- Recover complete memory candidates from token-limited output without marking incomplete extractions current.
- Surface recovered output as an incomplete, retryable draft and bound rejection diagnostics for review.
- Retain candidates within the processing limit and report overflow instead of rejecting the entire response.
- Generate memory IDs and source hashes on the server, and default omitted evidence from the trusted source note.

## 1.3.4 — 2026-09-18

- Kept a source note's extraction context unbound until its extraction succeeds, so a failed or cancelled preparation no longer rewrites the source note.
- Rejected concurrent source-context changes again at the final commit, so a late writer cannot be overwritten after extraction validation.
- Marked extractions whose only non-kept candidates were duplicates as current, so re-running them no longer churns.
- Kept error-diagnostic extractions from being marked current, including direct Game Mode preparation with requested context bound to draft and persistence metadata.

## 1.3.3 — 2026-09-18

- Kept static character and world facts static when their wording contains incidental narrative verbs, and stopped rejecting character facts that establish lasting status or affiliation.

## 1.3.2 — 2026-09-18

- Preserved all structured relationship participants and reused local identities when names arrive in short-name-first order.
