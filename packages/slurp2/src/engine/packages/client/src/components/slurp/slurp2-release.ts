      'Fixed Refresh Conversation Schedule failing with "chatComplete is not a function". It now creates the schedule.',

      "Fixed the header logo not loading. The logo is now built into Slurp and no longer depends on the package asset address.",
      "Added Reply timing settings under Messaging: the longest wait, the wait when the return time is unknown, check-in waits for close and regular fans, and away times for Creators without a schedule.",
      "Added Always reachable without a schedule. With it on, a Creator with no Conversation Schedule counts as online.",
      "Corrected the Creator settings text that said a Creator without a Conversation Schedule is always reachable. Slurp guesses from their last post unless the new setting is on.",

      "Added a way to write your own ad in Settings. Give it a brand, a product, ad copy, and a rating, and it joins the pool.",
      "Fixed feed ads stopping after the first server batch, content-rating limits being dropped, and one odd rating rejecting a whole batch.",
      "Fixed ad actions paying out for ads that were never served, and restored read tracking on the default Following feed.",
      "Fixed audience churn, relationship arcs, and subscription billing being starved by the world tick.",
      "Fixed recent Creator activity being ignored when replies and follow-ups decide whether a Creator is online. Drafts no longer count as activity.",
      "Stopped backups, restores, and deletion from overlapping world or Creator writes, and persona-operated Creators from speaking on their own.",
      "Creators no longer write first when you have turned their proactive messages off.",

      "First release of the Slurp remaster as its own package. It installs beside Slurp Legacy and keeps its own separate data.",
      "Added direct messages, scheduled follow-ups, commissions, an audience funnel, and creator earnings kept apart from spending money.",
      "Added a backup export and restore. A Slurp Legacy backup can be restored here, which is how you move your data across.",
      "Added a welcome screen. It appears after the install and after every update, warns that this is alpha software, and lists what changed.",
