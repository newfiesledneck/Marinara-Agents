/**
 * What a week under these settings would look like.

 * Pure, and deliberately the same functions the tick itself runs (`slurp-reach`,
 * `slurp-world-pulse`, `slurp-world`, `slurp-audience-subscription`), imported from the server
 * rules rather than reimplemented — an estimate that models the simulation with its own arithmetic
 * is a second simulation to keep in step, and it would drift the first time a rule changed.
 *
 * The sample creator is fixed on purpose: the number the settings screen shows is a comparison
 * between settings, not a forecast for one particular roster.
