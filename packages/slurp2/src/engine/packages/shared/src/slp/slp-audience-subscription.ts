 * in the storage begins with `getViewer(...)`, so only a player persona — an account row — could
 * hold a subscription, and the generated audience is deliberately account-less. The result was a
 * platform where the six ambient profiles were the only people who could ever pay.
 *
 * An audience member holds no wallet. They are not a viewer and they buy nothing else, so there is
 * no balance to debit and none is invented here: the money they pay is credited to the Creator and
 * that is the whole of the transaction. The audience commission path already settles money this
 * way for the same reason.
 *
 * This module decides only. Writing rows, crediting earnings, and recording events belong to the
 * world tick, which is the one place allowed to advance time.
