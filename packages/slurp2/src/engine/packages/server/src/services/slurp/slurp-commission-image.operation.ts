 * Draw the piece a fan commissioned.
 *
 * A commission is somebody paying a Creator to make a picture, and the delivery could only ever be
 * text. The fan paid, and then a sentence arrived. This closes that: the brief is the prompt.
 *
 * The brief is the fan's words, so it is treated as direction and not as authority. It is clamped,
 * and it goes through the same identity redaction and disclosure rules as any other Slurp image —
 * a secret Creator does not lose their face to a commission that asks for it.
