/**
 * The world moving while you watch it.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic, like the other Slurp rule modules.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A review found the world alive between sessions and inert during them. Fan activity runs four
 * times a day, and the world tick needs elapsed *days* to do anything, so a three-hour session saw
 * roughly one batch of comments and no world actions at all. For a roleplay product that is
 * backwards: immersion happens inside the session, and a reaction landing while you are reading is
 * worth more than a hundred that arrived while you were away.
 *
 * The design rule was already written down — "the trickle must be visible, likes must arrive while
 * the player watches" — and the implementation did the opposite.
 *
 * ## What it does
 *
 * Likes and follows only. No text, so no model call, so this can run on a session cadence without
 * costing anything. The expensive, interesting reactions stay on their own slower schedule; this
 * is the texture underneath them.
 *
 * Rate is driven by elapsed **minutes** rather than days, and capped per pulse, so reading the
 * page every few seconds does not farm reactions and coming back after a week does not dump a
 * hundred at once.
