/**
 * Advance the world.
 *
 * One function, two callers: the background tick and the catch-up when the player opens Slurp.
 * The plan requires exactly that shape, and it mirrors `applyStipend`, which bills on read and
 * needs no timer to stay correct.
 *
 * Everything here is free-tier. The maintainer's rule is that unattended work never calls the
 * model, so briefs and questions come from the combinatorial bank in `slurp-world-copy.ts`.
 * Auto-posting is the one exception to that rule and it lives in its own scheduler.
