/**
 * Advance the world.

 * One function, two callers: the background tick and the catch-up when the player opens Slurp.

 *
 * Everything here is free-tier. The maintainer's rule is that unattended work never calls the

 * Auto-posting is the one exception to that rule and it lives in its own scheduler.

 * Free tier: no model call, ever. All three kinds write a real interaction row, so they show as
 * named people, feed the funnel, and cost nothing. A "follow" differs only in how far it moves the
 * tie. A follow still counts when its like row already exists, so an earlier like never blocks it.
 *
 * A "comment" carries Tier 1 copy. Most comments on a real post are three words from somebody who
 * wanted to be seen typing them, and paying a model to write those is backwards: they are the
 * highest-volume text on the platform and the least worth reading. The batched run keeps the
 * model, and keeps it for comments that have actually seen the post.
