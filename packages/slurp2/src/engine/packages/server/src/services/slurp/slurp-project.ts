/**
 * A thread a Creator keeps posting about.
 *
 * Pure, like `slurp-goal.ts` and `slurp-milestones.ts` beside it.
 *
 * Slurp could vary a post and it could time a post, but nothing connected two posts to each other.
 * Every automatic feed was therefore a set of unrelated moments by the same person, which is the
 * one thing a real creator page is not: people follow a page to find out what happens next.
 *
 * A project is the smallest thing that supplies a "next". It holds what the thread is about and,
 * optionally, an ordered list of chapters to move through. Chapters are plain strings rather than
 * rows because an open-ended project — "she is renovating the flat, no idea how long it takes" —
 * has to cost nothing, and a table would charge for a plan the player never made.
 *
 * A project never owns the feed. It claims some posts and leaves the rest alone; see
 * `slurp-post-variation.ts` for the rotation that decides which.
