/**
 * Tip goals: the thing a Creator asks their audience for.
 *
 * Pure, like `slurp-wallet.ts`, `slurp-earnings.ts`, and `slurp-milestones.ts` beside it.
 *
 * A milestone is a goal the player aims at. A tip goal is a goal the player shows *other people*,
 * which is a different job: it gives the audience a reason to tip and turns a balance into a
 * shared target. It is core to the genre and Slurp had neither.
 *
 * Progress is measured from the lifetime earnings recorded when the goal opened, not from the
 * current balance. A balance falls when money is withdrawn, and a goal that slid backwards
 * because the Creator was paid would be nonsense.
