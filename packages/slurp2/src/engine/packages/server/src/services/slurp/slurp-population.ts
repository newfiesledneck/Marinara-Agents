/**
 * The audience, generated as data.
 *
 * Pure, deterministic, and free. This is the module that answers the finding the whole plan
 * started from: Slurp's entire background cast was **twelve accounts** — six ambient profiles and
 * six fan identities with placeholder handles like `quiet_regular`. Every like and reply
 * any Creator ever received came from those twelve, which is why the world read as repetitive,
 * incoherent, thin, and lifeless all at once.
 *
 * You cannot generate a population with a model. It is too slow and too expensive. So the
 * population is combinatorial: name parts crossed with archetypes crossed with traits. The banks
 * below produce hundreds of thousands of distinct people at zero cost, and a member is only ever
 * written to the database once they act somewhere the player can see.
 *
 * Nobody here has a profile, a post grid, or an avatar to generate. That is the maintainer's
 * constraint and it is what makes an audience affordable where synthetic creators were not.
