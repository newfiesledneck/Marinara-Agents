/**
 * Synthetic platform reach: the numbers that make Slurp read as a platform rather than a demo.
 *
 * Pure by design. Nothing here touches the DB, so the curves can be unit-tested without an Engine
 * checkout — the same reason `slurp-wallet.ts` and `slurp-prices.ts` stand alone.
 *
 * Slurp's real background cast is twelve accounts, so every count derived from real interaction
 * rows is tiny, and a creator with four followers cannot feel like a creator. Reach fills the gap
 * the cheapest way there is: a number costs nothing to generate and does most of the work of
 * feeling big. Only the handful of named, readable interactions still come from real rows.
 *
 * Two rules hold everything together:
 *
 * 1. **Deterministic.** Every value derives from stable inputs — an id, a creation time, a clock.
 *    The same post shows the same number on every read, in every session, forever. Nothing draws
 *    a random number at read time.
 * 2. **Stable under a fixed audience.** For a given `realFollowers`, growth depends on age through
 *    a saturating curve, and age only increases, so the synthetic part never falls between reads.
 *
 *    The total *can* fall, and that is deliberate. An earlier version of this module made
 *    monotonicity a rule, which was a design error stated as a principle: a number that cannot
 *    fall has no stakes, so raising it means nothing. What breaks the illusion is jitter — a value
 *    that differs between two reads of the same page — not decline the player earned by going
 *    quiet and losing subscribers. Real followers come from the funnel, and people leave it.
 *
 * Reach is presentation only. It never reaches the wallet, the ledger, a payout, or a subscriber
 * list. See `slurp-wallet.ts` for the numbers that must stay exact.
