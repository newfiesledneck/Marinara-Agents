/**
 * What the audience says when it asks for something.
 *
 * Tier 1 of the fidelity ladder: combinatorial, deterministic, and free. The maintainer's rule is
 * that unattended work never calls the model, so a request opened by a background tick has to be
 * writable without one.
 *
 * These stay deliberately vague. A template that tries to sound specific about a post it has not
 * read is worse than one that does not try: "can you do something with the blue lighting again"
 * is a lie when there was no blue lighting, while "something soft, whatever you feel like" is
 * true of anything. Specificity is Tier 2's job, and Tier 2 runs when the player is present.
 *
 * ponytail: fixed banks. If the same phrasing starts repeating in practice, widen the arrays
 * before reaching for the model — the combinations here already run into the hundreds.
