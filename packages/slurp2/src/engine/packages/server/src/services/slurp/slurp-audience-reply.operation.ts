/**
 * Tier 2 creator replies: the creator saying something real back to the audience.
 *
 * The free tier answers a three-word comment with a three-word thank-you, which is what a real
 * creator does and costs nothing. It cannot answer a comment that actually said something, and a
 * creator who only ever replies "🥺 thank you" is a different kind of bot from one who never
 * replies at all.
 *
 * Two rules shape everything here.
 *
 * **Unattended work never calls the model.** So this is driven from a read, beside
 * `drainSlurpPendingText`, not from the background tick. The player is present and the spend is
 * against text they are about to scroll past.
 *
 * **Being a particular fan has to change something.** Which comments earn a written answer is
 * decided by the same rapport the rest of the system runs on, so a regular who asked a real
 * question gets a real answer and a passer-by does not.
