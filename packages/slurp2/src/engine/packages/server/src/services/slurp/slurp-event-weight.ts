/**
 * How much one event is worth reading.
 *
 * Pure, like the other Slurp rule modules beside it.
 *
 * The maintainer set the volume at "a readable handful": ten to twenty notable events a day,
 * across every Creator, each one worth reading. A feed that cannot be cleared is a chore, so this
 * is a curation rule and not a log level. Weight decides three things: what surfaces at all, what
 * groups into a single line, and what order the rest appears in.
 *
 * Money is weighted above attention on purpose. A like is the cheapest thing a person can do; a
 * commission is somebody asking you to make something. Between two events the player has time to
 * read, the one that cost the other person more is the one worth showing.
