/**
 * What a Creator has earned. Separate from what the player can spend.
 *
 * Pure by design, like `slurp-wallet.ts` beside it: nothing here touches the DB, so the rules are
 * unit-testable without an Engine checkout.
 *
 * ## Why this is not the wallet
 *
 * Income used to land in the operating persona's own spending wallet:
 *
 *     recipientId = creator.sourceKind === "persona" ? creator.sourceEntityId : creator.id
 *
 * The two balances want opposite properties. Spending money must be **scarce**, or choosing what
 * to unlock means nothing — the daily stipend floor is 60 coins and an unlock costs 3. Earnings
 * must be **large and growing**, or running a Creator never feels like it worked. One number
 * cannot do both. With a real audience the point becomes sharp: a few hundred subscribers at 12
 * coins a week would end every spending decision in the game.
 *
 * So earnings are keyed by **creator account**, not by persona. That is also the only correct
 * answer for a character-backed Creator, which has no operating persona to credit at all.
 *
 * `coins` is the balance a payout may later move into spending money. `lifetime` only ever rises;
 * it is the score, and a payout must not reduce it.
 *
 * Existing installs keep whatever income already reached their persona wallets. Nothing is
 * migrated, because that money is already spent or already counted.
