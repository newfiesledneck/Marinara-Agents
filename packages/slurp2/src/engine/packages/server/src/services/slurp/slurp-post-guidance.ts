/**
 * What a post is *for*, by who can read it.
 *
 * A public post and a paid post were written from the same instructions, so a locked post sold a
 * subscription to somebody who had already bought one, and a public post gave away the payoff it
 * was supposed to advertise. The two now carry their own direction.
 *
 * This half is the shape and the precedence, with no database behind it, so the rules can be run
 * in a test. `slurp-post-guidance.storage.ts` holds the reading and writing.
 *
 * An empty string means "use the text one level up", which is why nothing here is defaulted to the
 * built-in copy: a Creator must be able to fall back to the global value, and the global value
 * must be able to fall back to the built-in one.
