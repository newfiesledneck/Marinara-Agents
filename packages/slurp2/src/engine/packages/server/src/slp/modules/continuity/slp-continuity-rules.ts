/**
 * Who may read a continuity record, and how a record's status may change.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic, like the other Slurp rule modules. Every read path filters through
 * `slurpContinuityReadable`, so privacy is decided in one place rather than at each prompt.
 *
 * ## Audience
 *
 * - A post reads the Creator's own facts: public ones, cross-platform ones, and their private plans
 *   and boundaries. It never reads anything that belongs to one fan.
 * - A fan's thread reads all of that, plus the private records of that same thread and no other.
 * - `canon_only` records exist for later adapters and reach only the editor.
 *
 * ## Reality
 *
 * Slurp reads what is literally true on Slurp: canon, Slurp, and campaign records. Conversation,
 * roleplay, and game records are stored for later adapters and never reach a Slurp prompt until
 * something explicitly promotes them. A scene is not history just because it happened.
