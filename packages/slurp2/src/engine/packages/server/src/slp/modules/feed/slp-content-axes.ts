/**
 * What a post is for, how it is delivered, and what happens to the plan behind it.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic, like the other Slurp rule modules.
 *
 * ## The problem
 *
 * Every post was the same kind of post: something happened, here is a picture of it, here is what
 * it meant to me. A creator page does not work like that. It sells, it teases, it thanks people,
 * it answers requests, it admits the work, it apologises for a quiet week, and sometimes it just
 * says good morning. A locked post that reads as a diary entry behind a paywall is not a product,
 * and the complete emotional arc in every single entry is why the feed felt written rather than
 * lived.
 *
 * ## The approach
 *
 * The intent is chosen before anything is written, and it decides what the caption is *for* — not
 * what it says. An intent never supplies a scene, for the same reason a variation never supplies
 * one: the Creator's own life has to answer.
 *
 * The delivery is chosen separately. A thank-you can be a Story or a plain text post; a set is
 * never text-only. Keeping the two apart is what lets a post be both.
 *
 * Stories come out of the format rotation in `slp-post-variation.ts`, and free teaser posts come
 * out of `slurpTeaserPost`. `slurpPostAxes` takes both as given, so the three decisions cannot
 * contradict each other.

 * share after `set`, and the housekeeping intents are kept rather than cut: they land precisely
 * because they are rare.
 *
 * The bottom of this list is the reason these are weights and not rotation slots. Ten slots meant
 * one boundary post every ten, which at four posts a day is a Creator announcing a limit every
