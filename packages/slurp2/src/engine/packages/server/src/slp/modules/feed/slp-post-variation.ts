/**
 * What makes this post different from the last one.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic, like the other Slurp rule modules.
 *
 * ## The problem
 *
 * Creators posted the same thing repeatedly — an office worker at her desk, in the same pose,
 * every time. Five causes, and only the last is about the model being unimaginative:
 *
 * 1. Post history showed the model `title — content` and never the image prompts, so it could not
 *    see that it had described the same desk eight times running.
 * 2. The only anti-repetition rule was "do not reuse their exact wording", which eight different
 *    captions about one desk satisfy completely.
 * 3. Nothing anywhere asked for situational variety. The generation guidance, including all three
 *    spice presets, is entirely about tone.
 * 4. Auto-posting hardcoded the `caption` format, so three of the four formats never fired.
 * 5. With no Conversation Schedule there is no situational anchor at all, so the character card is
 *    the only input — and a card that says "office worker" is constant, so the output is constant.
 *
 * ## The approach
 *
 * A variation supplies an **axis to differ along**, never a concrete scene. "Somewhere other than
 * where you usually post" lets the character's own life answer; "at a train station" would
 * overwrite it.
 * That is what keeps this from fighting the character card, and it is the maintainer's brief:
 * the same person, a different part of their life.
 *
 * Variations rotate rather than being drawn at random, so consecutive posts cannot land on the same
 * axis twice — which is exactly the failure being fixed.
 */

/**
 * How often each axis value turns up, for callers that draw instead of rotating.
 *
 * The rotations below step one place at a time, which makes every entry equally common and
 * perfectly periodic. That is how "in the room they spend the least time in" came to fire every
 * sixth post forever: a Creator who is supposedly never in that room was in it on a schedule. The
 * same arithmetic made every Creator "alone and not glad of it" every fifth post.
 *
 * These weights say what each entry should actually be worth. Most of the time a person is where
 * they usually are, doing something unremarkable, by themselves and fine about it.
