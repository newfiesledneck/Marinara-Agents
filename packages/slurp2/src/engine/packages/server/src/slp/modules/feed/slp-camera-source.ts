/**
 * Who is holding the camera.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic, like the other Slurp rule modules.
 *
 * ## The problem
 *
 * A Creator posts alone, and the picture is taken from the floor looking up, or from above her
 * head, or from across the room. Nobody in the scene could have reached those positions. The feed
 * is not broken because it is staged — a creator-platform post is normally staged — it is broken
 * because it claims to be candid while using production conditions the scene never paid for.
 *
 * `slp-post-variation.ts` caused a good part of this directly. Its `FRAMINGS` axis handed out
 * "from above, looking down" and "from low, looking up" as free-floating instructions, with no
 * tripod, timer, mirror, or second person anywhere to justify them. The image model did as it was
 * told, and every Creator ended up with an invisible cameraman.
 *
 * ## The approach
 *
 * Framing stops being an independent axis and becomes a *consequence* of who is holding the
 * camera. A selfie cannot be taken from further away than an arm. A tripod shot cannot show the
 * subject holding the phone. A second person cannot hold the camera when the Creator is alone.
 *
 * So the source is chosen first, and the scene has to pay for it: `permitted` filters the sources
 * against what the rest of the variation already decided. Produce mode uses weighted draws so a
 * common phone picture stays common without making the sequence periodic.
 *
 * Deliberately staged sources are here on purpose. A tripod shoot the Creator admits to reads as
 * more real than a candid shot that could not exist. The distinction that matters is not staged
 * against real, it is credible staging against unexplained access.

 * How often each camera turns up.
 *
 * These are weights rather than rotation slots on purpose. Six sources in a rotation meant an old

 * her posting schedule.
 *
 * The first cut of this table reasoned from photographs in general: a phone in your own hand is
 * how most pictures on earth are taken, so selfie took 42 and mirror took 22. But a mirror shot is
 * also a phone in her own hand, so together they were two posts in three, and the feed read as one
 * person taking the same picture forever. Photographs in general is the wrong reference class —
 * this is a page somebody runs, and a page that is only arm's-length phone pictures is a page
 * nobody is working on.
 *
 * So the weights now reason from the work instead. Hand-held self-shots stay the largest share at
 * a little under half, because they are still the cheap everyday post. A propped-up phone is what
 * an actual planned picture looks like and is now close behind. A still out of a video is common
 * on a page that posts video at all, and was badly underweighted at 10. Somebody else holding the
 * camera is rare because it needs somebody else, not because it is unusual when they are there —
 * the permitted-sources filter already removes it when she is alone, so its weight should reflect
 * how often it happens *given* company.
