/**
 * How this Creator makes things, as opposed to who they are.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic, like the other Slurp rule modules.
 *
 * ## The problem
 *
 * Every Creator produced the same kind of picture. Unrelated people, with unrelated cards, all
 * arrived at soft light, a flattering angle, a vulnerable expression and a camera that had somehow
 * been placed for them. The variation rotation gave them different situations, but it gave all of
 * them the same production grammar, so the feed read as one photographer working through a cast.
 *
 * A real platform has someone who shoots on a phone in a messy kitchen and someone who runs a
 * ring light and a backdrop, and the difference shows in every post either of them makes.
 *
 * ## The approach
 *
 * A production style is assigned per Creator and then stays put. It biases which cameras they
 * reach for, how polished any given post is, and whether they talk about the work at all.
 *
 * The style is keyed on the account id rather than read out of the character card's prose. That is
 * deliberate: sniffing a bio for words like "professional" is the kind of cleverness that fails
 * silently and in one language only, and keying on the prose would reshuffle a Creator's entire
 * production style the first time somebody fixed a typo in their bio. Keyed on identity, the style
 * survives every edit to the card, which is what "this is how she shoots" has to mean.
 *
 * ponytail: assigned from identity, not inferred from the card, and not author-editable. If
 * players want to say outright that a Creator runs a studio, this wants a real profile field on
 * the stage profile and a migration; the shape here is already the shape that field would take.
