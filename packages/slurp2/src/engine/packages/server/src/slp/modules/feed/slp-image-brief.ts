/**
 * The image draft for one post: short, positive, English sentences an image model can draw.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic, like the other Slurp rule modules.
 *
 * ## History
 *
 * This used to be a page of rules for a language model ("Describe the photograph, not the scene.
 * Never use a camera position nobody present could have reached …") that an image-prompt rewrite
 * was meant to turn into a picture. On a reasoning connection the rewrite never finished, so the
 * rules went to the image model as they were, were cut at 1500 characters, and the scene the post
 * model had planned was lost behind them. A diffusion model also reads a negation as a subject:
 * "no second body" draws one.
 *
 * The scene the post call writes is now the picture. This module only orders it and adds the
 * camera, effort, and level as plain visual phrases. Appearance and style are added later, where
 * the Creator's look and the Engine style profile are known.
