## Round 4 - commission delivery image generation

| Area                                 | Result                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Generate image from commission brief | Implemented in `slurp-commission-image.operation.ts` and wired to the delivery route |
| Generated media access               | Restricted to the thread viewer or Creator; locked PPV media returns 402             |
| Media cleanup                        | Staged media is compensated when generation or delivery fails                        |
| Client control                       | Creator delivery form has an explicit image-generation checkbox                      |
| Regression proof                     | `tests/slurp-review-fixes.regression.ts` checks route, hook, and UI wiring           |

The previous delivery flow accepted only text or a manually entered path. The new `generateImage` option sends the commission brief through the existing Slurp image pipeline. The image is promoted only after the delivery message exists. The generated image is then stored on that message and served through an access-checked route.

## Round 2 — main-functionality pass (live instance)

Driven against a real Engine 2.4.5 checkout (`/home/dev/engine-slurp-review`, `origin/staging`
@ `8685d537d`) with the built 1.2.3 artifact installed, through the HTTP API and a real browser.

### Feature added by request

Creators now publish Stories autonomously. `slurpPostBeat` gained a `story` flag on the caption slots
of its rotation, and the generation service marks the post `noodlerPostType: "story"` **only** on the
path that commits an image — a Story with no picture is not a Story. Before this, `postType: "story"`
was only ever set by the manual composer, so nothing generated one at all.

Both halves are the player's, not constants:

| Setting                                | Where                                        | Default     | Effect                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `storyRate`                            | Settings → Publishing → **Stories**          | `regular`   | Off / Rare / Regular / Often, mapping to 0, 1, 2 or 4 of the eight rotation slots. `off` is a real off switch. |
| `storyImageWidth` / `storyImageHeight` | Settings → Images → **Story width / height** | 1024 × 1280 | The size a generated Story is drawn at.                                                                        |

`regular` at 1024 × 1280 reproduces the behaviour shipped before the setting existed, so an install
that never opens Settings is unchanged. The composer crops an uploaded Story to the configured ratio
rather than to a fixed named aspect (`lockedRatio`), so the two halves cannot drift apart when the
size is changed. Verified live: the control renders, changing it persists (`storyRate = often` on the
server), and the route rejects an unknown rate or an out-of-range size with 400.

## Round 3 — unfinished and conceptually wrong features

A hunt for stubs rather than crashes: features that are declared, partly built, or wired to nothing.
Found by tracing each concept setting → server → response field → client render, and by listing
exported hooks with no callers.

| 27  | High     | **Creator promotions were a stub that mislabelled the player's own writing.** A hand-written post reading "Just made soup. Nothing to do with cosmetics." was stamped `slurpSponsoredPromotion: Velvet Skin · Midnight Gloss` and rendered "PAID PARTNERSHIP WITH VELVET SKIN". The promotion was never put in the prompt, so the text never mentioned the brand; there is no sponsorship earnings kind, so it paid nothing; exactly one creator ad existed, matched by substring of handle+bio against `beauty`/`fashion`/`night`; and it fired on every post with no frequency or off switch. | Reproduced live            | **Removed** — the stamping, the render, `creatorAdForProfile` and the one `kind: "creator"` base ad. Inline ads, which work, are untouched. |
| 28  | High     | **Creator message policy and prices had no UI.** `useSetSlurpCreatorMessaging` and `useSetSlurpCreatorPrice` had zero callers, so DM policy, first-message fee, locked-message price, rapport weights and a Creator's own weekly price could never be changed. Every Creator was stuck on `subscribers` / 5 / 8. The `paid` policy was therefore unreachable, which made the fee and the `messageRequest` earnings kind dead — while the localized "Your first message costs {{fee}} coins" copy shipped.                                                                                       | No callers; confirmed live | **Built** — a "Messages and prices" group in Settings → Creators, for persona-owned Creators only. Rapport weights left alone by choice.    |
| 29  | Medium   | **Commissions had no exit.** No decline route and no decline UI; `declined` shipped localized in all four locales but was unreachable, so an unwanted brief sat in the thread forever and the fan could not take it back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Routes and UI read in full | **Built** — one `decline` route either side may call while the commission is unpaid, plus Decline / Withdraw buttons.                       |

### Recorded, not changed

- `kind: "creator"` remains in the garnish-ads type and import schema with no consumer, so a
  creator-kind ad can still be imported and will never be shown. Left because garnish-ads is staged
  for extraction into its own agent and a future promotions feature will want the kind back.
- Rapport weights (eight dials) still have no UI, by choice — the mechanic is invisible to the player.
- Twenty settings-schema keys have no UI reference, most inherited from public Noodle
  (`participantSelectionMode`, `carryover*`, `invitedCharacterGroupIds`, `max*PerRefresh`). All are
  read somewhere on the server, so none is dead, but they are unreachable configuration.

## Build and release

Source payloads changed, so the package was rebuilt and the version bumped by one patch.

## Round 5 - commission image control

The server already supported generated commission media, but the client had no way to request it. Added a labeled checkbox to the Creator delivery form. The hook now sends `generateImage`, and the route generates from the stored brief before it writes the delivery message. Manual image paths remain supported. The checkbox is disabled when a manual path is present.

Focused checks passed:

- `npx tsx tests/slurp-review-fixes.regression.ts`
- `npx tsx tests/slurp-messaging-surface.regression.ts`
- `npx tsx tests/slurp-ppv-paywall.regression.ts`
- All `tests/slurp-*.regression.ts` and `tests/noodle-slurp-*.regression.ts`
- `npm run check`
- `npm run typecheck:packages`
- Catalog, locale, release-note, and diff checks

The package was rebuilt. Generated package and catalog files changed as required by repository policy.

## Round 6 - Stories

| Change            | Result                                                            |

| Story lifetime    | Client Story shelf window is now 72 hours                         |
| Shelf order       | Creator groups sort by their newest active Story, newest first    |
| Sequence playback | Stories from one Creator remain consecutive in the viewer         |
| Viewer recording  | One view per viewer and Story is stored through a dedicated route |
| Viewer list       | Owner-only endpoint returns count and viewer snapshots            |

The Story viewer records a view when a Story opens. The write is best effort and does not block playback. Story-view rows are excluded from normal interaction counts.

## Readiness

Source, tests, catalog, and artifact are consistent and every repository-required check passes.
Three rounds: an audit, a functional pass against a live Engine that found seven defects including
two that made subscribing and the whole coin-earning economy fail outright, and a stub hunt that
found five more — one feature removed as unsalvageable, three finished, one made honest.

Outstanding: the Playwright suite needs a machine with chromium's system libraries, and everything
model-driven (autopost content, Story and post images, ad copy, DM replies, world beats) is still
unverified because live generation was skipped. Everything else in this document was exercised
against a running instance.
