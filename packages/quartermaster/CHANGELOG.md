- Items can now be favorited with a star, which sorts them to the top of the Bag.

## 0.1.15 — 2026-09-15
- Fixed the Recent Agent Update box leak for real this time — 0.1.13 and 0.1.14 were both

- Widened the info tooltip box so long macro tokens read on one line.

## 0.1.14 — 2026-09-15

  resolve it either).

## 0.1.13 — 2026-09-14
- Attempted fix for Recent Agent Update's collapsed box showing a sliver of Restore Inventory
  underneath.

  Revert button.
