# Pixelforge release notes

## 0.16.5 — 2026-09-13

- World-generation failures show the measured request size and available context, and oversized requests identify the lore selection. World setup omits lorebooks and entries disabled for the chat.

## 0.16.4 — 2026-09-13

- Maintenance: remove an unused world-rendering alias.

## 0.16.3 — 2026-09-09

Select all the lore entries your world needs, including large entries and selections over 100. The picker and saved settings no longer clip choices to ordinary lorebook budgets. Engine checks the complete prompt against your model's context limit; if it is too large, the retry screen explains how to reduce the selection or use a larger context. Requires Engine 2.4.5 staging or newer.

## 0.16.2 — 2026-09-08

Tell the game what kind of world you want in your own words and it works out the rest. The theme
dropdown is gone: the setting you describe now decides whether you arrive in a village of stone and
timber or a colony under a sealed sky. The world name box starts empty too; leaving either alone no
longer answers for you.

Pixelforge also stops asking who is in your party — every game starts with an empty party this
release, and choosing one moves to Game Mode's own setup in the next — and it stops writing map
notes and story goals on your behalf that you never asked for.

You can now tick the exact lorebook entries the game reads before it writes your world, one at a
time or a whole book at once, so a place you have already written history for comes out knowing it.
It needs a newer Engine: on an older one your picks are ignored and the world is written from your
setting alone. An entry limited to specific characters is skipped this release, because there is no
party for it to match.

## 0.16.1 — 2026-09-07

Name your world and get your world. The Setting box arrived pre-filled, so leaving it alone quietly
asked for the village in that text — same valley, same innkeeper — whatever you called the game. It
starts empty now, with that description shown behind it as a suggestion. Leave it empty and the
world is built from what you did give: your game name and your theme. Type your own and it is used
exactly as written. Either way the place you arrive in has the name you gave it, and the loading
screen says which world it is writing.

Pixelforge games no longer generate the engine's HUD gauges, so the "Review Starting Widgets" step
is gone and the storyteller stops keeping a second purse beside the one the game uses.

The party list shows names instead of ids. The connection dropdown shows each connection's model,
starts on your real default, and hides ones still waiting on an import review.

Worlds you already have are untouched.

## 0.16.0 — 2026-09-06 [highlight]

Walk out of town and keep going. Past the settlement's edge the country carries on in every direction — woods, heath, scree, fen, far fields and fallen walls — made as you reach it and identical every time you come back, so the way home is the way you came. Roughly one patch in seven holds something worth finding, and finding it goes in your journal. Beyond that the wilderness does not remember you yet.

The town stops being the same town. Where its crossroad sits, the shape of its square, how its streets are laid and what the ground around it looks like now all follow the world's own seed, so two worlds no longer share a map. Worlds you already have are re-laid too, and keep everything in them — the same people, the same jobs, the same friendships.

And if part of your world never finished being written, you can now try that part again from inside the game instead of starting a new one.

The storyteller can now make someone a friend of yours, or turn them against you.

## 0.15.0 — 2026-09-04 [highlight]

The town starts knowing you. Talk with people, buy from them, take a room at the inn, finish jobs off the board — and the people it happened with remember. Passing the time of day gets you known, and that is as far as it goes: it takes doing something real for someone — a job off the board, or steady business over a counter — to make a friend of them. You will see it happen: a word the moment somebody warms to you, said in the same breath as whatever you were paid, their standing beside their name when you talk, and the storyteller greets a friend like a friend.

Friends talk differently. Every world already carries the things people would only say to somebody they trust — warmer, more familiar, less like a signpost. Now they actually say them, once you have earned it. And the people you work for remember which job it was.

Worlds and saves you already have carry straight over; nobody in them forgets anything they knew.

## 0.14.0 — 2026-09-02 [highlight]

The sky does something now. Every world is minted with a climate — how far north it sits, and how wet it is — and it keeps a calendar, so seasons turn, the light moves through the day, and rain, snow and storms cross the map instead of it being the same clear afternoon forever. Snow settles and the ground changes under it, and fish bite more often in bad weather.

Townspeople answer you. Talk to somebody in the village and what they say belongs to them — their work, the season, the weather outside the door, the hour — instead of one line everybody shares.

Worlds you already have keep their exact layouts.
