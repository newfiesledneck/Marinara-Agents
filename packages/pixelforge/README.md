# Pixelforge

A downloadable Game Mode **Experience** (capability package, `game-surface` slot): a walkable
top-down pixel village in the spirit of pre-3D Harvest Moon / Stardew Valley, rendered by a
package-owned Canvas2D engine. NPC dialogue flows into the normal GM turn loop, World Maps
(hierarchical spatial context) is read and written as you move, and combat hands off to the
engine's own vanilla combat — the package never replaces it.

Requires **Marinara Engine 2.4.3+** (capability API 1.10 for `contributions.assets`). It is
client-only: no server entrypoint, no restart after install. The package agent definition is a
runtime-inert stub that satisfies the catalog loader; all behavior lives in `client.js`.

## How to play

Install Pixelforge from the agent catalog, create a **Game Mode** chat, and choose **Pixelforge**
in the Experience chooser. Walk with the arrow keys / WASD or the on-screen D-pad, talk to NPCs to
drive the story, and let the GM narrate. The world saves into the chat (debounced), so reloading
resumes where you left off.

## World generation (0.4.0)

Since 0.4.0 the wizard's preferences drive what the world *is*, under one rule: **the LLM decides
what exists, the algorithm decides where every tile goes.** After launch the surface makes one
host-run structured generation call (`POST /api/game/:chatId/experience-generation`, Engine
2.4.3-staging+) with themed guidance and a strict schema; the model returns a compact **World
Brief** — settlement, cast with household structure, places, features — and a deterministic
compiler builds the tile world from it (30 villagers in 6 households → ~6 houses, never 30). The
brief is validated, repaired, and floored (`src/18-brief.js`, spec in `docs/brief-schema.md`),
then sealed into chat metadata; the compiled zones carry the prose the GM sees, metered so it
never taxes more than one turn.

**Since 0.11.0 generation is a LOADING GATE, not a background upgrade** (maintainer ruling, S5
§Q3b). Through 0.10 the chat booted a themed default world instantly and rebuilt in place when the
brief landed — and the discarded world was real enough to play, so a player could put ten minutes
into a place that was about to be thrown away. A chat configured to generate now shows a loading
state until its brief is sealed and its world compiles: the sim does not step, no player-state
mutator resolves, and no save is written until then.

A generation failure is a **retry screen**, never a default world sealed on the player's behalf:
nothing is stored, so the chat is exactly as it was and the next visit tries again. That is now
true of EVERY failure — 0.11 revised the 0.4.0-era ladder, which still sealed a themed default on a
deterministic 400/422; the retry screen says which kind of failure it was instead. Chats that
never asked for generation — pre-0.4.0 saves, and any chat whose brief was explicitly declined —
are untouched and play immediately on the themed default world, exactly as they did in 0.3.0.
**Declining is a checkbox in the setup** ("Generate a unique world with your GM connection"),
checked by default; unchecking it means no loading gate, no generation call, and no starting
purse — the themed village or colony, the moment the chat opens. The
known cost: on an engine whose generation route is missing entirely, every attempt is a transient
failure and the retry screen is the whole experience — the manifest's `engine.min` is what keeps
that off a supported install.

## Things, money and a bed (0.11.0)

0.11 gives the player a namespaced, versioned block of their own inside the save — a pouch and a
purse, skills and equipped tools, a relationship ledger, quest state, a day ledger, discovery
state, and a home anchor. It carries its own version and migrates on read, and a field a newer
build added survives a round trip through an older one rather than being deleted by its next save.
Everything else in the world stays a pure function of `(seed, theme, brief, clock)`, which is what
keeps a rebuild byte-identical and a timeline rewind safe. The wire contract, the three field
classes, the quarantine slots, the save-row decision ladder and the loading gate are specified in
`docs/player-state.md`.

What is *live* in 0.11 is deliberately small: the purse, the pouch, and one transaction.
**There is no automatic home** — a modern setting probably houses its protagonist and a wandering
adventurer probably does not, and only your setup and your GM know which — so the player-driven
path to a bed is **renting a berth at the settlement's inn**. Stand next to whoever keeps it and
the price is on the button; it costs money, hands you a key, notes the day in your ledger, and the
keeper remembers you. Renting the same room twice is refused, and so is renting one you cannot
afford. A new world starts you with a small purse so the first thing money is for is reachable;
quest rewards are the real income and arrive with the quest layer.

Item names and the currency are **theme-bearing** — a sci-fi colony pays in credits and issues
berth chits, not coins and room keys — and a theme that ships without naming them fails a
startup assertion rather than rendering raw tags at a player.

## Something to do with the day (0.12.0)

0.12 is the first release with a **second thing to do**. Stand beside water — a village pond, a
stream, a colony's coolant pool — and a **Fish** button appears, naming the water it is about.
Cast once, or fish until dawn, morning, dusk or night; a cast spends a fixed window of the clock,
and a session that runs past midnight carries on into the next day. What comes out depends on how
good you have got at it, what you are holding, and what time it is: each world has its own catch
tables, and the fish, kelp, hauls and salvage in them are named for the place they came out of.
Bait improves your odds and gets used up — and bait is also something the water gives back, so
fishing supplies itself. Running out mid-session is not a stop; you just carry on casting bare.

**Rods are bought, never given.** The innkeeper who lets you a room also sells tackle, one rung at
a time: your first rod is cheap and comes with a starter tin of bait, and the button offers you the
next one up until you own it, then goes away. A colony treats angling as a niche hobby and prices
the same first rod accordingly. None of it is compulsory — nothing in the game needs you to own a
rod, and any keeper anywhere will sell you the same next rod later, so you can ignore the whole
thing forever if fishing is not why you are here.

**Sleep, and a recap of the day.** With a bed — the berth you rent at the inn — you can sleep until
dawn, morning, dusk or night. Sleeping costs no GM turn at all: it moves the clock, and the next
message you send for your own reasons quietly carries a summary of the days that finished while the
narrator was not looking. So the GM finds out you spent Tuesday at the millpond without you having
to type it, and without a turn spent per cast.

**Two new panels, on chips beside the purse.** The **journal** (📖) is your day ledger, grouped by
day with the newest first, plus a band for the things that happened to the *save* rather than in a
day. The **character sheet** (👤, or the `C` key) is your skills and what they are worth, what you
have equipped, your purse, and how the settlement feels about you — drawn live, so a level earned
while it is open shows up as soon as it happens.

**Bridges.** Where a road runs through water, it is now planked over instead of the pond being
dropped for getting in the road's way — which is what lets the **wilds** have one at all: the pool
is wide enough that it always reached the road band the compiler holds in reserve, so a pond a brief
asked for out in the wood simply never existed. A walkway over a pool is also a perfectly good place
to stand and fish from.

## Work on the board (0.13.0)

Every settlement now has a **notice board** — a job terminal in a colony — standing where people
already gather: beside the inn's door, on the green, or on the road you spawn onto. Walk up to it
and a **Board** button appears. Reading it costs nothing and sends nothing.

**Four jobs a day, and they are the day's, not the board's forever.** Take one and it goes on your
jobs list; the offer stays on the board dimmed, as the day's receipt. Jobs never expire and never
cost you anything to ignore, so nothing on the board is a deadline. You can carry ten at once, and
when the list is full the board says so and names the two ways out of it — finish one, or set one
aside.

**Three kinds of work, and each finishes where it happens.** Catch this many fish and bring it back
to the board. Take word to somebody, which finishes the moment you greet them. Walk out to a place,
which finishes the moment you get there. Nothing has to be carried, and nothing has to be handed
over twice.

**What a job pays is money and the giver remembering you** — and that is the whole of it: a job
never hands you skill experience. Catching fish for a fishing order still levels your fishing,
because the *catching* does, but the reward is coins and a person who now knows you did them a
favour. **This is the release that gives you an income**, so the first rod stops being a thing you
have to have saved for.

**The journal grows a second tab.** Your jobs live beside your day ledger — what you are carrying,
with counts on it, and two tallies of what you have finished: the work this world posted, and the
generic work that travels with you into the next one. Setting a job aside is here and only here (a
board is the last place you want a mis-press), and it takes two presses.

**Where the work comes from.** A chat that generates its own world now makes a **second** generation
call after the brief is sealed, writing the jobs its own people would actually post — a miller who
wants fish, a forager who wants word carried — plus a matrix of things they say, which a later
release will put behind an Ask key. It happens once, at creation, behind the same loading screen;
after that the board restocks itself every day with no calls at all. If that second call fails,
nothing is lost and trying again is free: your world is already written and settled.

**Worlds made before 0.13 have no work written for them**, and their boards say so plainly rather
than pretending — "No work posted here", never "not yet" and never "check back". Chats that declined
generation get a hand-written stock set of jobs instead, posted by the four people the default
village stands up. Jobs you have already taken are never affected by any of this: they stay on your
list and finish normally, whatever the board is offering.

## Art

Two tiers, resolved at runtime with graceful degradation:

- **Tier 1 (shipped)** — per-theme tile atlases (`tiles.png` for cozy-village,
  `tiles-sci-fi-colony.png` for the colony theme, both sharing one `atlas.json` id map) and
  4-direction × 4-frame
  walk-cycle sprite sheets (`sprites/*.png` + `sprites.json`) generated at build time by
  `build/build-art.mjs` with a dependency-free PNG encoder (`build/png.mjs`). Deterministic for a
  given Node.js build: the pixel data never varies, but the PNG container bytes depend on Node's
  bundled zlib, so rebuilding on a different Node release may churn them — harmlessly, because the
  build re-stamps every hash from its own output and CI verifies committed bytes without rebuilding. Served through the engine's package-asset route via
  `contributions.assets`.
- **Tier 0 (fallback)** — procedural Canvas painters inside `client.js`. If assets fail to load
  (or on engines without asset serving) the game still runs, just plainer.

## Rebuilding

```sh
node scripts/build-pixelforge-package.mjs
```

Regenerates `client.js`, the Tier-1 assets, `manifest.json`/`agents.json`/`locales/en.json`, the
reproducible `artifacts/pixelforge-<version>.zip` (deterministic store-only zip, no system `zip`
binary needed), and the catalog lanes. Bump `VERSION` in the build script and update
`engine-boundary.json` when rebuilding against a newer engine.
