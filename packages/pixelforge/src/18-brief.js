  // every 8 rows and every 9 columns, and a map only 30 tall has room for two
  // rows of them however wide it is — so a village used to lay six lots on 1320
  // tiles and read as a hamlet with a lot of grass. Lots per rank now run
  // 4 / 8 / 16 / 36 / 80, which is the first progression where each rank looks
  // like a bigger VERSION of the one below rather than the same place zoomed.
  //
  // `buildings` is the ceiling on how many of those lots get laid out, and it is
  // deliberately kept ABOVE what the population arithmetic asks for at each rank
  // (20-world's RESIDENT_HOUSEHOLDS). The ground should permit and the people
  // should decide; when this number binds first, every settlement of a rank comes
  // out the same size no matter who lives there, which is the bug that made a

  // validate() above is a SEAL-TIME guarantee, and it does not survive the round
  // trip through chat metadata. `PF.save._configBrief` hands the compiler whatever
  // the metadata holds, and ~14 reads inside 20-world's compile() index tables with
  // it: a stored `prosperity: "constructor"` resolved to a function on
  // Object.prototype and cost a town 38 of its 48 zones with nothing said, and a
  // stored `scale` or `place.kind` threw and left build()'s catch-all degrading a
  // compiled settlement to the 3-zone legacy layout behind one console.warn.
  //
  // THIS IS A FOLD, NOT A SECOND validate(), and that is the whole design. Running
  // validate() again on read would re-run the seal-time POLICY passes too — the
  // per-scale feature and place caps, the floors, the dedupe — against a brief
  // sealed under a table that may not be this build's. A newer build that seats
  // four places at hamlet rank writes a brief this one would strip to two on every
  // load, which is the same silent zone loss the seam was opened for, arriving
  // through the front door. Seal time may DROP; read time may only FOLD. Every
  // array length, every name and every id crosses this function untouched, and
  // what changes is only a value the compiler was about to use as a table key.
  //
  // AND IT NEVER TOUCHES THE CALLER'S OBJECT. The brief the save path holds is what
  // PF.player.briefHashOf() stamps a save against, so a byte of it moving under the
  // load path is a SPURIOUS SEVERANCE — rel rows, quests and home quarantined for a
  // world that did not change. Neither hazard is theoretical: validate() reorders
  // `src.cast` in place on the leader-hoist path, and it is not byte-idempotent
  // anyway (a brief that took repairs at seal time re-validates with an empty
  // `_repairs`, and a stock top-up member's key order is not the main path's). So
  // the fold works on a deep copy that lives and dies inside build(), the stored
  // object stays the identity source it has always been, and `_folds` — the
  // read-side counterpart of `_repairs` — rides the copy and is never written back.
  //
  // Where the compiler's readings all agree on a fallback, the fold changes
  // nothing observable: an unknown `tint` was already grey's hue (`?? 210`) and an
  // unknown `tag` was already a plain rect with no painter — measured, those two
  // compile identically folded or not. Everything else MOVES, deliberately.
  // `prosperity` moving is this function's headline (the silent 38-of-48-zone
  // loss above). `place.kind` moves because FURNISH's `|| dwelling` was never the
  // only reading — upperPlan refuses non-household kinds outright and cellarPlan
  // gives them no cellar, so an unfolded unknown compiled to a stunted dwelling,
  // not a dwelling. `surround` and `standing` move to validate's own defaults,
  // which beat a flat ground mix and a person with no rest anchor. In every case
  // the fold's answer is the one seal time would have given, and a value naming
  // something on Object.prototype can no longer pretend to be a table's entry.

   *  DESIGN REVISION (this release, maintainer ruling #7 / plan §Q3b). The 0.4.0
   *  ladder sealed THEMED DEFAULTS on a deterministic/paid failure — 400 contract,
   *  422 provider/parse — on the reasoning that a paid call per visit is worse
   *  than the default world. That decision predates the loading gate and does not
   *  survive it: back then a default world was what the player was already walking
   *  in, so sealing it changed nothing they could see. Now the gate holds play
   *  precisely so that nobody invests in a world that is going to be discarded,
   *  and the README states the contract plainly — "a generation failure is a retry
   *  screen; nothing is stored". Sealing defaults on a 400 makes that sentence
   *  false in the one case a player cannot undo: the key is written, the chat is
   *  permanently a themed default, and the three paragraphs of setting they wrote
   *  are gone with no way back. The paid-call worry is also nearly hypothetical
   *  now — capPreferences clamps to 7,800 against the route's 8,000 cap, so the
   *  reachable 400 is a contract bug rather than a long setting.
   *
   *  `onFailure(kind)` reports WHY, once, so the retry screen can say something
   *  truer than "something went wrong" — a deterministic refusal and a busy engine
   *  want different sentences from the player. Kinds: "unavailable" (404/409/429/
   *  5xx), "refused" (400/422 with nothing salvageable), "network", "timeout". */
