// Deterministic seed → zones. A zone is a tile grid with three layers (ground,
// object, overhead), a solidity map, portals, and NPCs. No host GameMap types
// are used — the world model is wholly package-owned (exploration R09/R10).

   *
   *  Every key in it belongs to the HOST — a World Maps location id, authored by
   *  hand or by the wizard's map instructions, never written by this package —
   *  and on a plain `{}` the word "__proto__" is not a key at all. Writing a
   *  string there is a silent no-op (the prototype setter takes an object or
   *  null and drops the rest) and reading it back hands out Object.prototype.
   *  Both halves were reachable and neither failed loudly: 50-spatial's seeding
   *  write vanished, so its emptiness test re-fired and re-dirtied on every
   *  refresh forever while the world never gained a root to export under; and
   *  55-maps-export's adoption read came back Object.prototype, which is neither
   *  undefined nor the zone, so the export refused its own adoption and posted a
   *  TWIN of the location — through a route with no delete, onto a real map.
   *
   *  Fixed HERE rather than at the two sites because this is the one place the
   *  table is made: 60-save restores a save's bindings by copying entries INTO
   *  this object, so no plain map can arrive from stored state, and every read
   *  and write of it downstream (both files above, plus 70-hud's chip test) is
   *  covered by the one change. `Object.keys`, `delete` and `JSON.stringify` all
   *  behave identically, so an honest id is byte-identical either side of it. */
