// ── World Maps (spatial context) client ───────────────────────────────────────
// Authority rule (exploration §02): spatial context owns where the party is;
// the tile world is a view of it. Reads go through the same REST endpoint the
// host uses; writes ride sendMessage's third argument with optimistic
// concurrency. A location change with no in-flight command is narrated drift:
// teleport to the bound zone (or toast), never queue a compensating transition.
//
// Review-hardened: a generation counter guards cross-chat races (a refresh
// started for chat A must never write into chat B's world). Transition
// outcomes arrive two ways: engines with capability API 1.12 address the
// commit/reject events to this package (onHostEvent — immediate), and on
// older engines `pending` still self-clears after two refreshes with no
// movement (the stale-count fallback; events simply never arrive there).
