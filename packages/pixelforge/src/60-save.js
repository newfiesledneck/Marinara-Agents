// Two-tier, engine-version adaptive:
//   routes mode (engine #5102+) — GET/PUT /api/game/:chatId/experience-state is
//     the AUTHORITY: rows anchor to the visible message, so swipes, branches,
//     and checkpoint loads rewind the world with the story. checkRewind() polls
//     on each finished turn and rebuilds the sim when the server state moved
//     under us. Metadata stays a write-through cache (instant synchronous boot
//     + fallback if the chat later opens on an older engine).
//   metadata mode (older engines) — the Phase-1 behavior: one small `pixelforge`
//     key via the queued PATCH route, with the documented limitation that
//     timeline seams do not rewind it.
// Both: debounced, event-driven, flushed with keepalive on teardown — never
// per-frame (Android whole-blob-rewrite shape, exploration R11/R28).
//
// This module also owns the CREATION SEQUENCE, and as of 0.13 that is two paid
// calls rather than one: the world brief (18-brief) and then the offline content
// pack (61-pack), behind a single loading gate and a single in-flight hold. The
// window between them is a state 0.12 could not be in — a real, compiled world
// whose people have nothing to say yet — so the four consumers of "is this chat
// still waiting" are answered separately rather than by one widened predicate:
// the interim mark and stamp evaluability stay BRIEF-only (identity), the gate is
// the DISJUNCTION (content may hold play), and the lift is neither-owed. See
// briefExpected/packExpected, which sit beside each other for that reason.

// The envelope keys THIS build understands. Anything else on a restored save
// was written by a NEWER build: simFromSaved parks it on sim._envelopeExtra and
// snapshot() re-emits it. Without that, round-tripping a chat through an older
// client is data-destructive — the older read drops the fields on the floor and

  /** The sentence AFTER the reason, which is the half that differs by STAGE — and
   *  every clause of it has to be true in EVERY state its stage can be in, which is
   *  what 0.13 got wrong twice.
   *
   *  THE PACK STAGE HAS FOUR, not the two the first correction counted and not the
   *  three the second did. The pack call runs while the placeholder is still
   *  standing (a chat sealing both artifacts in one visit), it runs over a world
   *  that is already up (the half-sealed chat, matrix cell 3), the pack SEALS and
   *  the PATCH that would have stored it does not land (`_failGate(core, "storage",
   *  "pack")`, three attempts down), and — the one that was missed longest — the
   *  stage stays stamped AFTER the pack has sealed and stored, because the install
   *  or the resume under it can still throw and the catch-all inherits the stamp.
   *
   *  So the sentence may not name which call failed. The first version promised the
   *  retry "does not rewrite the world", which is false in state one: the install
   *  had not run and the retry is what runs it. The second said "what failed is the
   *  work posted in it" and "it re-attempts that work", which is false in state
   *  four: the work is written, stored and safe, the compile is what threw, and
   *  the retry makes NO second pack call at all — `packExpected` is already false
   *  by then, so the button lands on the recompile path.
   *
   *  What is true in all four is the shape of the thing rather than the name of
   *  it: the setting is spent and kept, the world compiles deterministically from
   *  it so it comes out the same however many times it compiles, what did not
   *  finish is something downstream of that, and the retry picks up whatever is
   *  still owed without touching what is already written. The storage state is the
   *  one that proves the note cannot carry the whole screen on its own: it is TRUE
   *  there, and the REASON above it was not until `gateReason` learned the stage.
   *
   *  THE BRIEF STAGE HAS TWO, and that is why it no longer claims the chat is
   *  untouched. The stage is stamped when the brief is owed, but the gate is not
   *  re-stamped once the brief SEALS on a chat that wants no pack — so a throw out
   *  of the install lands here with `pixelforgeBrief` already PATCHed, one-shot, and
   *  a retry that recompiles from it rather than re-rolling it. "Exactly as you left
   *  it" was false for that chat. What survives both is what ruling #7 actually
   *  guarantees: NO failure seals a world on the player's behalf, ever. */

   *  ── #5406, THE WRITE ORDINAL, CONSUMED ────────────────────────────────────
   *  The engine now stamps every experience row and every metadata key from ONE
   *  per-chat monotonic counter (GET and PUT both report `writeOrdinal`; the
   *  metadata side is mirrored at `metadataWriteOrdinals[<key>]`). It is BETTER
   *  EVIDENCE INSIDE THE ROWS BELOW and never a row of its own — the rows and
   *  their per-site actions are exactly what they were — and it is read in two
   *  places:
   *
   *   • ROW 5. The own-commit GATE is unchanged: "a PUT of ours completed while
   *     this GET was in flight". `_writeSeq` cannot say WHICH row that PUT landed
   *     on, so the suspicion was unfalsifiable and a perfectly current row was
   *     discarded whenever a write happened to overlap the read. With both
   *     ordinals present, a row at or past our own last PUT's ordinal already
   *     CARRIES that write — there is nothing for it to predate — so the
   *     classification falls through to the byte comparison instead.
   *
   *   • ROWS 6/7/8. The byte comparison still picks the row. The ordinal answers
   *     the one question bytes cannot (plan §Q2a): when the row differs from a
   *     baseline that is our own metadata-booted snapshot — row 6's precondition,
   *     no anchor of ours — is the row AHEAD of that cache or BEHIND it? A row
   *     strictly behind the mirror's entry for our key is provably older than the
   *     world we are standing in, and adopting it would throw away a degraded
   *     session's entire play. That is the §5 row #5406 was filed to close, and it
   *     classifies ROW 5, whose meaning it already is: this row predates a write
   *     of ours, so ignore it and let our write proceed over it.
   *
   *  THE ANCHOR OUTRANKS THE ORDINAL, and that half is load-bearing. The ordinal
   *  orders the two STORES; only the anchor orders the TIMELINE. So the mirror
   *  test fires only when the engine says the row is NOT the reader's own anchor's
   *  save (`anchorMatched !== true`, i.e. the row came back as the namespace's
   *  latest fallback and makes no claim about where the reader is). Without that
   *  guard a swipe-back taken while the tab was closed would stop rewinding the
   *  world — because a healthy flush ALWAYS leaves the mirror one ordinal ahead of
   *  the row it paired with, the row being written first.
   *
   *  A TIE IS THE SAME WRITE, not a newer one, so both tests compare strictly.
   *  Either side unorderable — a pre-#5406 engine, a row cloned from before the
   *  feature, a mirror clobbered by a whole-blob metadata write — and every branch
   *  falls back to exactly the byte ladder that shipped without it. */

   *  fires. So the gate here is 2 × TextEncoder-encoded bytes ≤
   *  KEEPALIVE_PAIR_BUDGET_BYTES, and when the pair does not fit the PUT goes
