// ── The player state block (S5) ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// One namespaced, versioned `player` block inside the save snapshot: inventory
// and money, skills and equipped tools, the relationship ledger, quest state,
// the day-ledger buffer, discovery state, and the home anchor. Everything else
// in the world stays a pure function of (seed, theme, brief, clock) — that is
// what keeps a rebuild byte-identical and a rewind safe.
//
// THREE PROPERTIES, declared per field (plan §0):
//   • world-free  — means the same thing in any world (pouch, skills, board-done)
//   • world-bound — meaningless once the world changed under it (rel, quests,
//                   found, home, ledger lines)
//   • coupled     — `flushedDay`, which is only interpretable against the lines
//                   it gates, so it is quarantined WITH them and clamped when
//                   they go (plan §0, §Q3a)
//
// The block carries its OWN version (`player.v`), not the envelope's: an
// envelope bump would force a player migration that changes nothing, and a
// player bump would invalidate envelopes that were fine (ROADMAP §S5).

// The player block's schema version is DERIVED from the migration table, never
// written twice: `MIGRATIONS[i]` takes v(i+1) to v(i+2), so an empty table is
// exactly "v1, and v1 is the identity". A step and a version constant that can
// disagree is a bug waiting for its first migration.

const currentPlayerV = () => PLAYER_MIGRATIONS.length + 1;

// Size caps (plan §4), and they do not all bite the same way. Stated honestly
// because a consumer in slice 6 has to know which calls can come back empty:
//
//   EVICT (the cap makes room and the call succeeds) — relLines evicts the
//     oldest line and leaves its row standing; boardDone / packDone evict the
//     least-earned counter; ledgerDays / ledgerPerDay / ledgerStubs compact the
//     buffer; found evicts the oldest discovery; `notices` evicts the oldest
//     TOLD row, and an untold one only when every row is untold.
//   TRUNCATE (the value is cut, the call succeeds) — lineChars, ledgerChars,
//     skillLevel (the level stops climbing and xp is zeroed at the ceiling).
//   REFUSE (the call does nothing and says so, which is the part the old header
//     denied) — `items`: grant() returns 0 when the pouch is full and the item
//     is a new (t,k) row; `activeQuests`: quest("accept") returns false;
//     `relRows`: bump() returns null when the cap is reached and there is no
//     STRANGER-tier row left to evict for the newcomer.
//
// THESE ARE GAMEPLAY AND HYGIENE BOUNDS, NOT A SIZE BUDGET (maintainer ruling,
// round 2). A previous pass shrank every one of them to hold a saturated town
// inside a 24 KB "design budget" carried over from a mobile-payload worry, and
// what that bought was settlements that feel tiny. The budget is abolished. The
// only real walls are the Engine's per-row cap (MAX_SNAPSHOT_CHARS, 262,144 —
// the server 422s above it) and the browser keepalive quota on the pagehide
// teardown path specifically; a saturated world sits far under both, and
// test-brief case (ah) MEASURES the shape and asserts against those walls rather
// than a budget. Size optimization is explicitly deferred: nothing below is
// chosen for bytes. The numbers are the plan's own.

// the two vocabularies share one field and must not share one validator. So the

   *  the day gate rises to `throughDay`, and every notice that rode the same tell
   *  is marked told.
   *
   *  IT GUARDS ITSELF, which is the one thing about it that is not ordinary. The
   *  invariant is `flushedDay ≤ ledgerOwed < sim.day` and this is the only writer
   *  that can RAISE the gate, so a burn that would raise one refuses unless
   *      flushedDay < throughDay ≤ intro.ledgerOwed  and  throughDay < sim.day
   *  with all three read from the LIVE sim at write time and not from whatever
   *  the sender was looking at when it composed. A burn AT the gate raises
   *  nothing, so it is held to `throughDay ≥ flushedDay` and no more: its whole
   *  job is marking a notice-only tell, and a PARTIAL RESTORE can leave the gate
   *  standing over a marker that owes nothing — a state the burn did not write
   *  and cannot repair, but must not be starved by (see the guard body). That is what closes the seam the
   *  generation fence cannot see: `_gen` moves only on a chat switch, while
   *  `_rebuild` replaces `core.sim` wholesale WITHOUT touching it (a rewind, a
   *  swipe, a checkpoint load), so a send resolving over a rewound sim passes the
   *  fence and would otherwise write a future gate onto the rewound block.
   *
   *  `notices` IS THE ROWS THE COMPOSE CAPTURED — `pending.ledger.notices`,
   *  handed back through the sender's closure-local pending — and not the live
   *  band read again here. The guard is NOT enough to make those two the same
   *  set, and that is the whole reason for the parameter. The guard reads three
   *  numbers, and three of the five notice writers move none of them: the
   *  dangling-quest repair, the mint severance and a restore landing on a gate
   *  already where it was all append to the band while leaving `flushedDay`,
   *  `ledgerOwed` and `day` untouched. Every one of them runs inside
   *  `_rehydratePlayer` ← `simFromSaved` ← `_rebuild`, which is UNFENCED on the
   *  same chat — so a rebuild landing mid-send hands the burn a live band with a
   *  row NOBODY COMPOSED in it, and a re-read would mark it told. The band
   *  answers to that flag and to nothing else, so a told row nobody was told is a
   *  sentence destroyed in silence: no gate to re-open, no day to re-select.
   *
   *  Marking the CAPTURED rows is safe in the same interleaving for the opposite
   *  reason: under a rebuild they are orphans of the sim that was replaced, and
   *  writing a flag onto an object nothing reads any more is a no-op. The fresh
   *  notice stays untold and rides the next compose, which is the only turn that
   *  can honestly carry it.
   *
   *  Returns true when it wrote and false for every refusal — the fence, the
   *  loading gate, a day that is not a day, the backwards gate, and (for a burn
   *  that would raise the gate) either of the two day inequalities.
   *  The senders SWALLOW the refusal (no toast, no retry): a guard refusal after
   *  an accepted send leaves the tell in history un-burned and the next compose
   *  re-tells it, which is a §5 lost-flush cause and not something to interrupt
