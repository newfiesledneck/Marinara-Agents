   *  window and lands wherever that leaves the clock. So this one takes minutes
   *  and not a daypart.
   *
   *  IT WRAPS MIDNIGHT, and it has to. A cast window is a multi-minute jump, so
   *  a session that starts at 23:50 crosses into the next day — a DESIGNED path,
   *  since "fish until dawn" is on the verb's own menu. The walking loop above
   *  can never be more than one day out because it ticks a minute at a time;
   *  this can, so the wrap is a loop rather than a test.
   *
   *  `resolveSchedules()` then runs UNCONDITIONALLY, unlike the walking loop's
   *  boundary test. A jump of any size can cross a daypart, and asking whether
   *  it did costs the same as re-placing everybody in a world where nothing
   *  moved — which is what waitUntil already concluded one method down.

   *  among them, and a second silent gate here would turn one of them into a
   *  no-op nobody could tell from a cast that caught nothing.
   *
   *  `_clockAcc` is deliberately left alone. waitUntil clears it because it
   *  JUMPS to a target and a leftover fraction would tick that target's minute
   *  early; an advance lays whole minutes on top of a fraction the player has
   *  genuinely already walked, and clearing it would quietly lose it.

   *  A LINEAR SCAN, and the reason it used to give for that is no longer true.
   *  It said casts are capped at ~10; the compiler now mints residents to fill a
   *  settlement, and a thriving city puts a hundred and thirteen of them on one
   *  exterior zone at midday. So this was re-measured rather than left on a stale
   *  assumption: `stepNpcs` over that zone costs 0.0039ms a frame, against 0.0019
   *  for a village of 25. Four thousandths of a millisecond is 0.02% of a 60fps
   *  budget, so an occupancy index would still be the more expensive of the two.
   *
   *  It stays a scan because it is cheap, NOT because the cast is small. If a
   *  zone ever holds several hundred, measure again before believing this. */
