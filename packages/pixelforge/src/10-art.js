// ── Tier-0 procedural art ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The deterministic bottom rung: a fixed 32-colour ramp and canvas-painted
// tiles/sprites so the game is playable with zero assets and zero network.
// Later tiers (authored atlas, AI bake) resolve above this and fall back here.
//
// THEMES (0.4.0): tile ids are SEMANTIC (grass/path/wall/roof/...), and a theme
// re-skins them — a palette override plus, where a recolour isn't enough, a
// painter override. The same zone grammar renders a cozy village or a sci-fi
// colony; the semantic layer is what the world compiler targets.
