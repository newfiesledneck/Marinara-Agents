// ── Things and money (S3), and the first thing to spend money ON (P1) ─────────
// The player block has held a pouch, a purse and a `home` field since S5 slice 3
// and nothing has ever put anything in them. This is the layer that does: the
// item VOCABULARY (what a `{t,k}` row is called and how it reads in this theme),
// the fixed PRICE list, and the one live transaction 0.11 ships — renting a berth
// at the settlement's inn, which is simultaneously S3's first money sink and the
// bed P5's day-ledger boundary will need (plan §2, Decisions #2).
//
// WHY A BERTH AND NOT A HOUSE. Maintainer ruling #2: there is NO automatic home.
// A modern setting probably houses its protagonist and a fantasy adventurer
// probably sleeps where they can, and only the setup/GM knows which — so the
// block ships the FIELD (booting null) and the player-driven path is renting a
// room. Home ASSIGNMENT channels (a setup flag, P6 building) are enumerated in
// the plan and deliberately not here.
//
// Everything below is CONTENT plus the game-facing entry points: the OFFERS
// (berthOffer, rodOffer) describe and never charge, so the HUD can call them
// every frame; the VERBS (rentBerth, buyRod, grantStartingPurse) mutate. The
// rest — _skin, currency, money, describe, price, the catch tables — is the
// vocabulary those read through. It holds no state of its own: what persists
// goes through the shipped mutators (award/grant/setHome/log/bump) and lives in
// the player block, which is what makes it rewind-safe.

// The catch table's TYPE vocabulary — the fixed shared roles a table entry can
// be, and the one non-catch yield water gives up. A table row carries a role and
// a VARIANT slug ("carp", "kelp", "vat-strain"), and the role is the half that
// means the same thing in every theme, which is why the xp table below is keyed
// by it.
const CATCH_ROLES = ["catch-common", "catch-uncommon", "catch-rare", "catch-prize"];
// Bait is a real water yield and not a catch (fishing is bait's own finder), so
// it sits outside the roles and still earns through the same table: the award
// keys on `role ?? BAIT_TYPE`, which is what stops a bait-first session from
// minting no skill row at all on a player who has plainly been fishing. A table
// entry with no `role` IS a bait entry — one field, read one way.
const BAIT_TYPE = "bait";
// The types whose `k` is a VARIANT SLUG rather than a tier or nothing. describe()
// keys their display name on `k`; PF.player.TOOL_TYPES is the other half of the
// same split and keys on the type's own name with `k` as an adjective in front.
const VARIANT_TYPES = new Set([...CATCH_ROLES, BAIT_TYPE]);

// The closed item vocabulary. A pouch row is keyed `(t, k)` — type and quality —
// and `t` has to mean the same thing in every theme or a save crossing a theme
// change would be renaming the player's belongings. So the TYPES are shared and
// only the SKIN (what it is called, and the glyph the purse shows) is per theme.
const ITEM_TYPES = ["lodging-key", "rod", BAIT_TYPE, ...CATCH_ROLES];

// The skill verbs this build ships a row for. A `skills.verbs` key is world-FREE

const SKILL_VERBS = ["fishing"];

// The four daypart words, which is the axis a catch table's multipliers are keyed

// anything else, which is what stops a plausible-looking "evening" column from
// shipping as a multiplier that never applies.
const DAYPARTS = ["dawn", "day", "dusk", "night"];

// The two feature tags that hold fishable water — the closed brief vocabulary's
// own words (18-brief FEATURE_TAGS), and the second half of a catch table's key.
// A spot's kind is where it stands in the world's shape, not what it is called:
// still water and running water fish differently in any theme, so the table set
// is (theme × kind) and both halves are asserted complete at boot.
const SPOT_TAGS = ["water-feature", "water-crossing"];

// ── What comes out of the water (plan §2.2) ──────────────────────────────────
// One table per (theme, spot kind). An ENTRY is `{role, variant, weight,
// minLevel, daypart}`:
//   • `role`   — the shared TYPE, one of CATCH_ROLES. ABSENT means bait, which is
//                a yield in its own right and the only one that is also an input.
//   • `variant`— the entry's slug, and the pouch row's `k`. Row identity is
//                `(role, variant)`, so kelp never merges into carp and a stack of
//                one thing is a stack of one thing.
//   • `weight` — relative share of the successful casts this table answers for.
//   • `minLevel` — the level the entry becomes REACHABLE at; below it the entry
//                is not in the draw at all, which is what makes the ladder feel
//                like it opens water up rather than merely raising a percentage.
//   • `daypart`— per-daypart multipliers over `weight`, absent meaning 1. This is
//                0.12's ONLY live modifier (weather is L2, M9) and it is where a
//                night spot stops being the same spot as a noon one.
// NO PER-ENTRY XP: TUNING.catchXp is the single authority, keyed by TYPE, so a
// rebalance happens in one place and cannot half-happen.
//
// SCI-FI IS NOT FISH-FREE (M6 RULED). A colony that stocks a coolant pool eats
// carp out of it; what the theme adds is flavored variants beside the real fish
// and non-fish yields — kelp cultures, filter salvage — that are legitimate
// entries and not consolation prizes.

// PACING, stated so a retune can be checked against an intent instead of a
// feeling. The FIXED side is the ladder: leaving level `l` costs 10l xp
// (PF.player.xpPerLevel) against a ceiling of CAPS.skillLevel 20, so the cap is
// Σ 10l for l = 1…19 = 1,900 xp and nothing below can move it. The target is
// that a player who fishes as their day's work gets there in a few dozen of
// those days. At `castMinutes` 15 a ten-hour day is 40 windows; mid-curve
// (decent rod, BAITLESS, halfway up the ladder) lands p = 0.48 × 1.15 ≈ 0.55, so
// ≈ 22 of them yield; a common-heavy table pays ≈ 1.8 xp a yield. Call it 40 xp
// a day, and the cap is ≈ 48 days of nothing but fishing. A day fished BAITED
// throughout is the same chain times `baitMult`: p ≈ 0.69, ≈ 50 xp, ≈ 38 days —
// which is the honest range, since no real session stays on one side of it.
//
// THE CATCH TABLE MOVES THAT AS MUCH AS THIS OBJECT DOES, and the BAIT SHARE is
// the sharpest lever in it: bait pays `catchXp[BAIT_TYPE]`, the floor, and it
// also refills the stack the bait multiplier rides on — so a high bait weight is
// a self-sustaining, slow-earning table, and a low one drains toward baitless
// casting at the lower multiplier. Recompose the table and the arithmetic above
// has to be redone.
//
// PRICE INTERPLAY — A NOTE FOR TUNERS, NOT AN INVARIANT (maintainer override,
// 2026-08-24). Nothing in this build asserts that a starting purse can afford a
// rod, a berth, or both, and that is deliberate: 0.12 ships no income mechanic,
// nobody is required to sleep in a rented berth, and income arrives in later
// releases. The rod-against-berth fork is a PLAYER's choice and the build
// declines to have an opinion about it. What a tuner should know while moving
// numbers: STARTING_PURSE 40 against a 12-coin berth and the 6-coin fantasy
// entry rod leaves room for both several times over, while the 24-credit sci-fi
// rod turns the same purse into a real decision — and a player who spends the

  // the prompt only through the sleep-recap flush (Ruling 1, M10).
  //
  // REFUSAL VALUES, each distinct, all of them read before a single minute is
  // spent:
  //   gate-held      — a world nobody has entered has no water in it yet.
  //   wrong-mode     — walk only, like every other clock mover.
  //   not-near-water — no registry row under the player's hand, or one whose tag
  //                    is not a kind that holds water.
  //   no-rod         — REACHABLE and deliberately so (M8's amendment): the
  //                    button stays visible for a rodless player and answers with
  //                    a themed hint pointing at the keeper who sells one, which
  //                    is what makes the mechanic discoverable instead of
  //                    invisible.
  //   pouch-full     — at the row cap only MERGES can land, so a session would
  //                    spend real hours to be told nothing new. Refused up front
  //                    rather than half-working. (Conservative on purpose: a
  //                    merge would still succeed. The mid-loop refusal below is
  //                    the other end of the same cap and does not refuse the
  //                    session.)
  //   unknown-target — a CALLER error and not a player-facing one; the menu can
  //                    only produce the four daypart words or none at all.
  //   no-player      — the same class, and listed rather than folded into one of
  //                    the five above: there is no player block on this sim at
  //                    all, which Sim's constructor and every restore path make
  //                    unreachable in play. Like unknown-target it is answered by
  //                    the HUD's GENERIC line (70-hud fishRefusal) instead of
  //                    copy of its own, because a control that spoke its own
  //                    sentence here would be writing player-facing words about a
  //                    state no player can be in.
