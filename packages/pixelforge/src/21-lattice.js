// ── The wilderness lattice ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// What is past the settlement's edge, as a TOTAL FUNCTION over cells rather than
// a set of places somebody built. The settlement stands at cell (0,0); every
// other cell has a definition whether or not a zone for it has ever existed, and
// materializing one is a CACHE FILL, not a decision. Nothing here is saved: a
// chunk is recomputed byte-identically from (seed, theme, axes, surround, cell)
// on every load, exactly like the settlement it hangs off.
//
// THREE RULES HOLD THE WHOLE MODULE UP, and every one of them is a lane:
//
//  1. ONE CELL, ONE STREAM. Every chunk draws from `hash(seed,"wild",cx,cy)` and
//     from nothing else — never the compiler's main stream, never visit order,
//     never another system's side stream. So materializing the cell east of you
//     cannot move a tile in the cell north of you, cannot move a tile in the
//     town, and cannot depend on which one you walked into first.
//  2. GATES ARE ARITHMETIC, NEVER RECORDS. A lattice edge is `zone.gates`, a
//     list of border tiles with a direction, and where it LEADS is computed at
//     step time from the cell the zone stands in. Nothing is ever written into
//     `zone.portals`, so the shipped "every portal's target exists" contract —
//     the one `checkWorld` asserts over every world the harness hands it — needs
//     no relaxation, and there is nothing to dangle when a neighbour is evicted.
//     (A hand-count of those call sites stood here and went stale inside one
//     arc, which is why the claim names the checker instead of counting it.)
//  3. GATES ARE PUNCHED IN TWO PHASES. Positions are computed BEFORE a zone's
//     tree scatter and reserved against it; the paint lands AFTER everything
//     else, and the pocket seal runs after the paint. Both halves are load-
//     bearing and neither is optional — see `reservationsFor` and `punchGates`.
//
// The lattice is COMPILED-WORLDS-ONLY. `buildLegacy` writes no gates, carries no
// cell and gets no wilderness: nobody should be playing on the fallback map, and
// a way out of it is the retry surface's business, not geometry's.

   *  whole-shard write today, and a lattice walk crosses a boundary every six to
   *  eight seconds of straight walking — so an unbatched twenty-minute walk is a
   *  hundred and fifty of those, where a town session is a handful. A cell-to-
   *  cell step therefore writes NOTHING event-shaped: the walk's position rides
   *  the thirty-second positional autosave the frame loop already runs, which
   *  `sim.dirty` has been feeding all along. No new timer, no second leash, and
   *  no fork with the shared debounce the retry ladder and the rewind corrective
   *  both hold. Everything else keeps the write it has: leaving town, arriving in
   *  it, a discovery, a quest, a conversation.
   *
   *  The cost is the status quo's, stated rather than discovered: a hard browser
   *  kill mid-walk can lose up to thirty seconds of position — a cell or two of
   *  backtrack, in country that regenerates identically. An ordinary tab close
   *  loses nothing at all; the teardown flush snapshots the live sim
   *  synchronously, past the debounce and past the dedupe caches. */

   *  Only a LANDMARK cell is written down. `player.found` is an eighty-row
   *  ledger shared with every future discovery consumer, and it evicts the
   *  oldest by DAY — so a writer that filed every patch of heath would fill it
   *  with terrain inside a day's walking and then start evicting the ruin
   *  somebody found on day three. Worse: at a same-day tie the eviction falls
   *  back to whichever id sorts first once a reload has re-sorted the array
   *  (58-player `discover`), so a saturated ledger keeps what SPELLING decides.
   *  Writing rarely is what keeps the ledger meaning something.
   *
   *  Two limitations, said out loud rather than left to be found: `found` is the
   *  last eighty discoveries and not a map of everywhere you have been; and the
   *  same-day tie-break above is a one-field fix belonging to whichever arc next
   *  owns this ledger, not to this one.
   *
   *  `d` KEEPS ITS SHIPPED MEANING — the depth of a sub-zone. A cell three rings
   *  out is `d: 0` like everything else standing on the surface: distance is not
   *  depth, and writing one into the field named for the other would poison the
   *  composite key for the enterables the field was minted for.

  /** WHICH CELLS SHOULD STOP STANDING. Pure: it reads a world and answers with
   *  ids, it changes nothing, and asking twice gives the same list.
   *
   *  A resident cell costs its tile arrays and — the megabytes — the renderer's
   *  two composites, and the cost is ADDITIVE: the settlement keeps its own
   *  canvases the whole time, so a walk pays for the town it left plus every
   *  patch of country it has crossed. On a lattice with no edge that is a leak
   *  with a walking pace, which is why the policy is a hard count.
   *
   *  THE REFUSALS COME FIRST, because the list this must never take is longer
   *  than the list it takes:
   *   - the zone the player is standing in — dropping it is a frame that draws
   *     `undefined`;
   *   - the settlement, checked by name as well as by id: `cellZoneId` answers
   *     (0,0) with `world.startZone`, so a world whose start zone were somehow
   *     spelled like a cell would otherwise be evictable;
   *   - anything the brief named, every interior, every floor, every dwelling —
   *     a place with a name, a `rel` row, a quest handle or a portal record
   *     pointing at it is not a cache entry, and none of those ids are cell ids;
   *   - a cell holding an NPC. Vacuous today (C6: no cell has residents) and
   *     load-bearing the day one does — a schedule handle whose zone was dropped
   *     is a person who stops existing mid-errand.
   *
   *  Then RECENCY and only recency: the `keep` most-recently-entered cells stand
   *  and the rest go, oldest first. A cell nothing ever entered — one a reload
   *  compiled to stand the player in, say — ranks oldest of all. Ties break on
   *  the id, so the answer is a function of the world's CONTENT rather than of
   *  the order somebody happened to compile it in.
   *
   *  Refused cells past the budget are simply kept, which is where the ceiling's
   *  slack comes from: residency is `keep` cells, plus whatever cannot be taken,
   *  plus the one a step has just materialized and not yet arrived in. */

  /** THE EFFECT, and the only thing in this module that destroys anything.
   *
   *  Two clears per cell, and both are load-bearing. The zone object takes the
   *  tile arrays with it and the `_snowable` memo hung off it; the renderer's
   *  composites are cached under `<id>|base` and `<id>|snow` and are where the
   *  memory actually is, so a delete without `invalidateZone` would be the same
   *  leak with the zone's name filed off — the picture outliving its world, and
   *  a stale one waiting for whatever zone is next given that id. The renderer
   *  has carried `invalidateZone` with no runtime caller since the day it was
   *  written; this is the caller.
   *
   *  Nothing here is saved and nothing here is a decision: a cell walked back
   *  into recompiles byte-identically from the same four inputs, which is what
   *  makes dropping it free rather than lossy. The recency order KEEPS the ids
   *  of cells it has let go — it remembers further back than residency holds, so

   *  wilderness avoids arming a whole-shard save per cell.
