# Slurp Audience Simulation Plan

Make the Slurp 2 audience simulation believable, fast, and fully tunable by users — including
user-defined fan types — while keeping every model call deliberate and budgeted.

Target: **slurp2 0.0.10**, one version bump, delivered in slices (one commit per slice).

This is a handoff artifact. A fresh agent should be able to pick up any slice from here.

## Why

A user shipped `slurp2-tune.py`, a regex patcher for the minified installed `server.mjs` that
rewrote reach, world-event rates, subscription budgets/conversion, spend-tier weights, tone text,
reply length, and schedule prompts, and then re-hashed `installed.json`. It did not deliver what
they wanted, and nobody should have to patch a bundle to tune a simulation.

Findings from tracing the source (`packages/slurp2/src/engine/packages/server/src/services/slurp`):

- **Subscriptions barely happen by design.** Default price 12; 62% of members are spend tier
  `none` (budget 0); affordable followers convert at 2–12% per day, rolled once per UTC day, and
  the roll only runs on the maintenance cadence (`CHURN_MIN_ELAPSED_DAYS = 0.5`). Ambient accounts
  in `audience` are not population members, so the subscription loop skips them.
- **Likes stall.** The pulse is capped at 6 actions per tick, 3 minutes per reaction at reference
  reach 3000, posts ≤ 48h, a pool of 24 awake members, one like per actor per post.
- **Follows can silently fail.** `applyPulse` records a follow as a `"like"` interaction. If that
  actor already liked the post, nothing is created and the tie never reaches `follower`.
- **Reach / rate edits don't touch follows or subs.** They only feed commission/DM/question
  chances in `slurp-world.ts`.
- **Fan archetypes are labels.** The six Engine archetypes only weight actor selection. The
  prompt never describes them; spend tier, traits, active hour, and funnel odds live elsewhere as
  constants.

## Principles

1. **Numbers are free, readable text costs.** State changes run constantly. The model only writes
   text somebody will read.
2. **Bank first, model second.** Every text has a free version. The model upgrades it when it
   matters and the budget allows.
3. **Deterministic.** Same seed and time → same world. No jitter between reloads.
4. **Everything tunable.** No hidden constants in rules; values come from Tuning or a Fan Type.
5. **Guardrails.** zod min/max on every value, plus hard code ceilings on events per tick and
   model calls that no setting can exceed.

## Architecture

```
Config (Tuning · Fan Types · Model Budget)
   │ read
Rules (pure, no DB) ◄── Banks (shipped + grown, per fan type)
   │ plans                    ▲ fills
Free Clock (tick) ──jobs──► Model Worker (queue · priority · budget · mode)
```

- **Rules**: existing pure modules (`slurp-reach`, `slurp-world-pulse`, `slurp-world`,
  `slurp-audience-subscription`, `slurp-population`, …) take their numbers as input.
- **Free Clock**: `slurp-world.operation.ts`, split into ordered steps.
- **Model Worker**: `slurp-pending-text` generalized into a job queue.

## Tiers

| Tier         | Content                                                | Cost        | Clock      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| 0 Numbers    | reach, counts, funnel, subs, churn, arcs, income, mood | free        | every tick |
| 1 Bank text  | pulse comments, request templates, creator replies     | free        | every tick |
| 2 Rewrite    | placeholder → specific text when read                  | model       | worker     |
| 3 Generation | comment threads, DM replies, briefs, arcs, schedules   | model       | worker     |
| Bank growth  | one batched call fills all low per-type banks          | model, rare | worker     |

## Data model

### SimulationTuning (Slurp settings)

```ts
SimulationTuning {
  preset: "quiet" | "realistic" | "lively" | "generous" | "custom"
  clock:   { tickMinutes; backgroundTimer; catchUpHours; maxEventsPerTick }
  reach:   { floor; ceiling; growthDays; realFollowerWeight }
  pulse:   { minutesPerReaction; referenceReach; maxPerTick; likeBudgetScale; postMaxAgeHours; oldPostTrickle; poolSize }
  world:   { maxActionsPerTick; maxOpenRequests;
             commission: { floor; cap; curve }; message: {…}; question: {…};
             questionNeedsRecentPost }
  funnel:  { rollCadence: "daily" | "hourly"; churnDays; ambientCanPay; conversionGrowth }
  economy: { audienceCommissionPrice }
  prompts: { tones: { warm; mixed; unfiltered }; fanActivityExtra; replyMaxChars; scheduleExtra }
}
```

`realistic` equals today's constants (plus bug fixes). Editing any value flips preset to `custom`.

### FanType (Slurp settings, list)

```ts
FanType {
  id; name; builtIn; enabled
  share                                   // population weight
  engineArchetype                         // nearest Engine NoodlerFanArchetype, for the Engine interface
  voice                                   // prompt text, ≤ ~600 chars
  traits: string[]
  activeHours: { peak: 0-23; spread: 1-12 }
  behavior: { activity; like; follow; comment; question; dm; commission; tip; unlock }
  spend: { weeklyBudget: [min, max]; commissionBudget: [min, max]; tipChance }
  funnel: { followChance; subConversionPerDay; loyaltyDays; renewChance }
  tone?: "warm" | "mixed" | "unfiltered" | string
  bank: { targetSize }
}
```

Built-ins (editable, resettable):

| Engine archetype | Built-in      | Sketch                          |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| ordinary         | Regular       | medium activity, light spender  |
| eccentric        | Night Owl     | late peak, odd voice            |
| crossFandom      | Crossover Fan | comments, rarely pays           |
| raider           | Troll         | blunt voice, no spend           |
| organicDiscovery | Newcomer      | high follow chance, low loyalty |
| freeResource     | Lurker        | likes only, never pays          |
| ordinary         | Superfan      | converts, tips, long comments   |
| ordinary         | Whale         | rare, big budget, commissions   |

### ModelBudget (Slurp settings)

```ts
ModelBudget {
  mode: "off" | "present" | "background"
  connectionId: string | null
  callsPerHour; callsPerDay
  jobs: { [kind]: { enabled; priority; maxPerDay } }
}
```

### Table changes

| Table               | Change                                                                           |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `slurpPopulation`   | add `fanTypeId`; `weeklyBudget` numeric (from `spendTier` range)                 |
| `slurpAudienceTies` | add `followedAt`                                                                 |
| interactions        | follows get their own interaction type                                           |
| `slurpPendingText`  | generalized to model jobs (kind, subject, priority, status, attempts, expiresAt) |
| reaction bank       | keyed by `fanTypeId`                                                             |
| new budget ledger   | calls per hour/day, survives restarts                                            |

## Free Clock

Triggers: Slurp read (as today) and a server timer every `tickMinutes` when `backgroundTimer`.
Shared lock + mark, so ticks never overlap or double-apply.

Steps per tick (pure plan → write):

1. Time: elapsed since mark, capped at `catchUpHours`.
2. Presence: who is awake (fan type `activeHours`).
3. Pulse: likes / follows / bank comments / views / unlocks. Like budget scales with reach,
   separate from the follow+comment cap. Older posts get a small decaying trickle.
4. Funnel: advance ties; follow chance from fan type.
5. Money: subscribe / renew / lapse (daily or hourly key), tips, income. Runs every tick.
   Conversion grows with interactions and time since `followedAt`.
6. World events: decide commissions / DMs / questions; bank text now; enqueue rewrite jobs.
7. Relationships: churn, audience arcs, rapport (maintenance cadence).
8. Creators: mood, modifiers, bank replies to comments.
9. Events: notifications, capped.
10. Jobs: enqueue model jobs for new visible text.

No step calls the model.

## Model Worker

| Priority | Job                | Trigger                                                                      |
| -------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | `dm_reply`         | player messaged a fan                                                        |
| 2        | `rewrite`          | placeholder item opened/visible                                              |
| 3        | `thread`           | post published                                                               |
| 4        | `brief`            | commission request open                                                      |
| 5        | `bank_grow`        | a type's bank below target or repeating (one batched call for all low types) |
| 6        | `arc` / `schedule` | weekly                                                                       |
| 7        | `fan_type_voice`   | user clicks "Draft voice"                                                    |

Modes: `off` (banks only), `present` (default; worker runs while a Slurp client is active),
`background` (opt-in; timer also drains priorities 3–6).

Claim a job only when the ledger has hour and day headroom. Stale jobs expire. Failed jobs keep
their bank text — nothing ever renders blank.

## Fan Types behavior

- Custom types map to an Engine archetype, so the Engine interface is unchanged.
- Deleting a type moves members to a chosen fallback type.
- Changing shares affects new members only; "Rebalance population" reassigns after a preview.
- Fan-activity, rewrite, and DM prompts receive each actor's `voice` + traits + tie.

## UI

New components, not more lines in `SlurpSettings.tsx` (already ~5k lines):

```
Settings → Audience
  Overview    preset picker · live estimate · import/export
  Fan Types   list with share bar → editor (voice, traits, behavior, spend, funnel, bank preview)
  Simulation  clock · reach · pulse · world · funnel · economy (Advanced toggle)
  AI Budget   mode · connection · limits · per-job toggles · usage today
  Prompts     tones · extra instructions · reply length · schedule additions
```

Live estimate runs the same pure rules client-side over 7 simulated days for a sample creator:
followers, subs, income, likes, requests, model calls per day. A test asserts estimate and tick
share the same rule functions.

Import/Export: `{ version, tuning, fanTypes, budget }` JSON, validated and clamped by zod.

## Migration

- Missing `tuning` → Realistic preset.
- Members without `fanTypeId` → built-in mapped from `archetype`; `spendTier` → budget in range.
- Existing follow-as-like rows stay; new follows use the new type.
- `slurpPendingText` rows → `rewrite` jobs.

## Decisions

- One version bump: slurp2 → **0.0.10** (patch bumps only for Agents packages).
- No per-creator tuning overrides for now.
- Existing members keep their type on upgrade.
- Free tick also runs on a server timer.
- Background model mode exists as opt-in.
- Bank growth is one batched call covering all low fan types.

## Validation

- Pure regression tests per rule with Tuning inputs, determinism, catch-up cap, budget ledger,
  fan type deletion fallback, follow-after-like.
- Re-derive the pre-existing slurp test failure baseline before comparing.
- `npm run check`, catalog/locale/release-notes validators, rebuild slurp2 package and catalog.

## Baseline (pre-existing failures)

Derived on `origin/staging` (8924a8c8) before slice 1, running each test with `npx tsx`.

- `tests/slurp2-*.regression.ts` (21 files): 3 fail — `slurp2-branding`, `slurp2-bughunt`,
  `slurp2-restore-settings-follow`.
- `tests/slurp-*.regression.ts` (85 files): 12 fail — `slurp-alive`, `slurp-feed-layout`,
  `slurp-identity`, `slurp-lifecycle-safety`, `slurp-onboarding-failure-reasons`,
  `slurp-payment-clarity`, `slurp-phase1-durability`, `slurp-population`, `slurp-ppv-paywall`,
  `slurp-relationship-panel`, `slurp-stance`, `slurp-studio`.
- `node scripts/typecheck-packages.mjs slurp2`: no undefined names (clean).

## Slice 2 notes (for later slices)

- Follows still write a `"like"` row; the tie advances even when that row exists
  (`slurpPulseTieAdvance`). A distinct follow interaction type was skipped: the Engine interaction
  schema and like counts would need it too. Revisit with Fan Types if follows must be listable per post.
- `slurpAudienceTies.followedAt` added (file table, nullable; old rows read null = 0 days following).
  It is set once when a tie first reaches follower and is not cleared on lapse.
- Subscriptions run every tick: full tie scan with a per-tick member cache (`ponytail:` in
  `slurp-world.operation.ts`). Slice 3 (server timer) multiplies this cost; add a batch member getter
  or a due-date filter if ticks get slow.
- Ambient accounts pay on the spend tier their id would generate when `ambientCanPay`; slice 5 should
  map them onto a Fan Type instead.
- `pulse.likeBudgetScale`: 1 = shared plan exactly; <1 drops a share of likes; >1 adds reach-scaled
  likes bounded only by `SLURP_TUNING_PULSE_PER_TICK_CEILING`. Slice 4 live estimate should call
  `planSlurpWorldPulse` directly.
- `clock.catchUpHours` now drives `slurpWorldElapsedDays` (72h = old 3 days). `tickMinutes`,
  `backgroundTimer` and `maxEventsPerTick` are still unread (slice 3).

## Slice 3 notes (for later slices)

- The timer is the existing `slurp-world-scheduler.service.ts` (already started/stopped via
  `addTeardown` in `server-entry.ts`). It wakes every `clock.tickMinutes`, re-reads settings each
  wake, and ticks when `slurpWorldTimerDue` says so: every wake with `backgroundTimer`, else the old
  6h cadence (`SLURP_WORLD_IDLE_POLL_MS`). Slice 8's background worker mode can hang off this wake.
- Lock: no new guard. `tryNoodleOperation("slurp-world-tick")` already refuses overlapping ticks
  (`busy`) for the read catch-up and the timer. In-process only (`ponytail:` note for a DB lease).
- `clock.maxEventsPerTick` caps `recordCreatorEvent` through `slurpCapTickEvents` (tick storage,
  including arc events written inside storage). Commission/message events written by the messages
  storage are not counted; they are bounded by `world.maxActionsPerTick`.
- Subscription scan skips the member read for ties that cannot decide (paid through the future, or
  unpaid and not `follower`). Still a full tie scan; batch getter deferred.

## Slice 4 notes (for later slices)

- The client imports the server rule modules directly by relative path
  (`../../../../server/src/services/slurp/...`), as it already imports `packages/shared/src`. The
  bundler resolves it and `zod` comes along from `packages/shared/node_modules`; nothing had to move
  into a shared package. Slices 5–9 should keep doing this rather than duplicating rules.
- `SlurpSettings.tsx` lost its five shared controls to `SlurpSettingsControls.tsx`
  (`NumberSetting`, `SectionTitle`, `SettingsGroup`, `GuidanceBox`, `Field`, `Toggle`). Fan Types,
  AI Budget and Prompts panels should import those, not copy them. `NumberSetting` now takes
  `integer={false}` for fractional fields.
- `SlurpSimulationSettings.tsx` reads every min/max and whether a field is a whole number off
  `slurpSimulationTuningSchema` at runtime, so a changed range needs no UI edit. New fields only
  need a row in its `FIELDS`/`TOGGLES` tables plus two `en.json` keys.
- A preset keeps the current `prompts` block rather than overwriting it: prompt text is edited in
  its own section (slice 9) and a preset must not silently throw it away.
- Preset values reviewed: quiet is half the activity (6 min/reaction, 3 per tick, like budget 0.5,
  curves ×0.5), lively is two to three times (1.2 min/reaction, 15 per tick, like budget 1.5, a
  0.1 old-post trickle, curves ×2.5), generous is lively plus an hourly conversion roll,
  `ambientCanPay`, `conversionGrowth` 3, like budget 2 and an 80-coin commission price.
- The estimate (`slurp-simulation-estimate.ts`) runs the real rule functions over seven days for a
  fixed sample creator, mirrors the tick's separate pulse mark, and treats half the pool as ambient
  so `ambientCanPay` is visible in it. The model-calls column is slice 9's.
- Import/export and the Fan Types, AI Budget and Prompts sections are still unbuilt; the panel is
  mounted inside the existing Audience section rather than in new nav sections.

## Slice 5 notes (for later slices)

- `services/slurp/slurp-fan-types.ts` is the module slices 6–9 read. Public API:
  `slurpFanTypeSchema` / `slurpFanTypesSchema` / `SlurpFanType`, `SLURP_BUILTIN_FAN_TYPES`,
  `slurpFanTypesDefault()`, `slurpNormalizeFanTypes()`, `slurpResolveFanType(types, member)`,
  `slurpFallbackFanType()`, `slurpPickFanType(types, seed)`, `slurpFanTypeWeeklyBudget()`,
  `slurpFanTypeCommissionBudget()`, `slurpFanTypeSpendTier()`, `slurpBuiltinFanTypeForTier()`,
  `slurpFanTypeActiveHour()`, `slurpFanTypeTraits()`, `slurpFanVoiceForPrompt()`,
  `SLURP_FAN_VOICE_MAX` (600) / `SLURP_FAN_VOICE_PROMPT_MAX` (240).
- Settings hold `fanTypes: FanType[]`, defaulting to the eight built-ins. `normalizeSlurpSettings`
  repairs rather than replaces: unparseable or duplicate entries are dropped, an empty result falls
  back to the built-ins, and an all-disabled list re-enables built-in Regular.
- Built-in shares are chosen for two distributions the rest of the code depends on: the old spend
  mix (62 / 25 / 11 / 2) and every Engine archetype holding more than a tenth of the crowd
  (`slurp-population.regression.ts` asserts the second). Editing a share moves both. Regular 25,
  Night Owl 11, Crossover Fan 11, Troll 11, Newcomer 11, Lurker 18, Superfan 11, Whale 2.
- `spendTier` was kept, not removed: it is derived from the member's weekly budget
  (`slurpFanTypeSpendTier`) and is still the vocabulary of prompts, the fan card and the route
  payloads. `SLURP_AUDIENCE_WEEKLY_BUDGET` and the daily-conversion table are now read off the
  built-ins rather than written out again, so they cannot drift from them.
- `slurpAudienceSubscriptionDecision` takes optional `weeklyBudget` and `subConversionPerDay`;
  without them it falls back to the tier tables, which is what the estimate and the old tests do.
  Slice 9's estimate should start passing the resolved type through.
- `slurpPopulation.fanTypeId` is a new nullable file-table column (the `followedAt` precedent).
  Old rows read null and resolve through `archetype`; there is no migration pass and none is needed.
- Wired: `behavior.activity` (pulse actor pick), `behavior.like` / `follow` / `comment` and
  `funnel.followChance` (pulse kind pick, via `planSlurpWorldPulse({ actorWeights })`),
  `spend.weeklyBudget` + `funnel.subConversionPerDay` (subscription pass),
  `spend.commissionBudget` (audience commission settlement), `activeHours` / `traits` /
  `engineArchetype` (generation), `voice` (fan-activity, pending-text rewrite, DM prompts).
- Still unread: `behavior.question` / `dm` / `commission` / `tip` / `unlock`, `spend.tipChance`,
  `funnel.loyaltyDays` / `renewChance`, `tone`, `bank.targetSize`. The first group belongs to
  `slurp-world.ts`, which decides per creator rather than per actor and would need a per-actor
  pass; `bank.targetSize` and `tone` are slice 6's, the rest belong with the funnel rework.
- `planSlurpWorldPulse` is unchanged when `actorWeights` is absent, so the estimate and the older
  pulse tests still see the fixed 18 / 16 / 66 split. Slice 9's estimate can pass weights to show
  fan types in the preview.

## Slice 6 notes (for later slices)

- Storage kept its name and changed shape: `settings.audienceReactionBank` is now
  `{ shared: string[], byType: Record<fanTypeId, string[]> }`. The schema entry is
  `z.unknown().transform(slurpNormalizeReactionBanks)`, so a legacy flat array normalises into
  `shared` with nothing dropped and no migration pass. The Settings textarea edits `shared` only.
- `slurp-reaction-bank.ts` is the pure module slice 7 reads: `slurpNormalizeReactionBanks`,
  `slurpReactionBodiesForType(banks, fanTypeId, starters)`, `mergeSlurpReactionBankBatch`,
  `SLURP_TYPE_BANK_THIN` (12). A type under twelve bodies of its own also draws the shared bank;
  at or above it, only its own. `SLURP_SHIPPED_TYPE_REACTIONS` in `slurp-world-copy.ts` holds three
  starter bodies per built-in, so a fresh install already sounds different per type.
- `slurpAudienceReactionFrom(seed, pool)` is the new entry point; `slurpAudienceReaction` is a thin
  wrapper over it and is unchanged for old callers.
- Growth is one call for every bank under target (`shared` plus up to nine types), each brief
  carrying the type's name, voice, tone and a six-line sample, answered as `{ [bankId]: string[] }`.
  Refused, malformed, or all-duplicate answers return `unavailable` and write nothing.
- Rebalance: `planSlurpFanTypeRebalance(members, types)` in `slurp-fan-types.ts` (pure, deterministic
  on the member id, so preview equals apply and a second run is a no-op) plus
  `GET /slurp/fan-types/rebalance/preview` and `POST /slurp/fan-types/rebalance`, both returning
  `{ changed, counts: { [typeId]: { before, after } } }`. Storage gained `population.setFanType`.
  Reads at most 5000 members; a bigger population needs paging.
- `funnel.renewChance` is wired: an affordable subscriber now rolls to renew on the same cadence key
  as the conversion roll. `funnel.loyaltyDays` was skipped — nothing stores when a subscription
  began, only `paidThroughAt`, so it needs a column and belongs with the funnel rework.
- `bank.targetSize` and `tone` are now read. Still unread from slice 5: `behavior.question` / `dm` /
  `commission` / `tip` / `unlock`, `spend.tipChance`, `funnel.loyaltyDays`.

## Slice 6a notes (for later slices)

- `slurpRhythmMultiplier(at, rhythm)` lives in `slurp-tuning.ts` (no new module: it is four lines
  of table lookup and belongs next to the settings it reads). It multiplies the existing `activity`
  dial in `slurp-world.operation.ts`, so both `planSlurpWorldPulse` and `planSlurpWorldTick` get a
  rhythm with no new plumbing, and the estimate applies the same multiplier per simulated tick.
  UTC. `HOUR_SHAPE` is a 24-number table rather than phase maths because the trough (04:00) and the
  peak (21:00) are seventeen hours apart, not twelve.
- `nightQuiet` was left alone: it holds back the _Creator's_ auto-posting overnight, in local time.
  The rhythm is the audience thinning out, which is a different thing, so nothing was merged.
- New tuning: `rhythm { enabled true, nightLow 0.7, eveningHigh 1.25, weekendBoost 1.1 }` and
  `pulse { wordOfMouth 0.002, viralChance 0.02, viralMultiplier 4, viralHours 12 }`.
  `pulse.oldPostTrickle` moved from 0 to 0.05. Realistic swings by less than 2.5× across a day,
  which is deliberate: this is texture, not a behaviour change.
- Word of mouth is a second pass in `planSlurpWorldPulse`, like the like budget: expected follows
  are `reach × wordOfMouth × days`, with the fractional part taken as a chance rather than floored
  away (at a five-minute tick the fraction is the whole of the expected value). Clamped to
  `SLURP_TUNING_PULSE_PER_TICK_CEILING` before the loop, and it skips actors whose Fan Type never
  follows. It lands on top of `maxPerTick`, so `slurp-world-pulse.regression.ts` now bounds a plan
  by the hard ceiling rather than by `maxPerTick`.
- `slurpPostViralMultiplier(postId, ageHours, pulse)` is deterministic on the post id and
  time-boxed by `viralHours`; it multiplies that post's weight inside the plan, so it costs nothing
  and cannot add actions.
- Lapses are now readable. `slurpLapseReason()` (`slurp-audience-subscription.ts`) answers
  price / quiet / drift from budget, price and days since seen; `slurpLapseNote()`
  (`slurp-world-copy.ts`) writes the line, with a separate warm bank so a warm audience never
  produces the blunt version. `slurpEvents` gained a nullable `note` column (the `followedAt`
  precedent: no migration pass), the route spreads it through, and `describeEvent` in
  `SlurpHome.tsx` appends it in quotes. Any later event kind can carry a bank line the same way.
- Only the subscription path writes the event. The churn pass lapses non-subscribers, and
  "let their subscription lapse" would be a lie about somebody who only ever liked a post.
- The dedupe key was checked, not changed: `createNoodlerWorldInteraction` dedupes on
  (post, actor, **type**, parent), so a like never blocks a later comment on the same post. The
  plan's own `postId:actor` key is per pulse only.
